         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:152298:6"/> fruicts of your labours; for we may well ſay of this ſeeming shrubbe, which you haue plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: that it is <hi>tanquam li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnum, quod plantatum eſt ſecus decurſus aquarum: quod fructum ſuum dabit in tempore ſuo.</hi> It is like vnto à Tree planted by the water ſide whith bringeth forth fruict in due ſeaſon: for this your tree, was no ſooner planted: but it beganne to ſprout forth leaues of rare examples; Its root was ſcarſe ſetled in the ground, but its branches loaded with pietie, deuotion and learning did extend themſelues to the gayning of ſoules: as ſoone as the waters of grace had wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

            <p>Father <hi>Thomas Bullaker</hi> vpon his arriuall into England being taken and empriſoned, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracted ſuch diſeaſes, through miſerie and want, which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in priſon; that he neuer had his health after: yet: the zeale of ſoules, which brought him vnto his country; forced him with vndaunted courage to come to london, in the greateſt
<pb facs="tcp:152298:7"/> rage of Perſecution, to helpe the poore diſtreſſed Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques: which he did both ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and temporally; vntill ſuch time, that being taken at Maſſe, whilſt he was ſaying <hi>Gloria in Excelſis:</hi> he was empriſoned againe, condemned, hanged, drawne and quartered, when his ſoule did aſcend to ſing eternally a canticle of Ioy in heauen.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Paule</hi> of <hi>S. Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> alias <hi>Henry Heath,</hi> twiſe Guardian of your Convent at Douay, and once Commiſſarie Provinciall in theſe parts, and long ſince Reader of Diuinitie: after hauing well profited in his ſtudies in Cambridge; by
<pb facs="tcp:152298:7"/> reading of the holy Fathers, and diſputing with others; he was the occaſion of the converſion of many, wherof ſome became Religious: and after God touching his heart, he did reconcile himſelfe vnto the Catholicke church and comming beyond ſeas to Douay he entred into the order of our holy Father <hi>S. Francis:</hi> and therein liued with ſo great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie, that indeede it was more to be admired than imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated: for to omit his blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diſciplines, wherewith moſt parts of the houſe are marked; his lying on the ground con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; his haire-cloaths of of ſeuerall ſorts; his chaines,
<pb facs="tcp:152298:8"/> girdells, and bracelets of Iron: his life was in a manner, à con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall faſt; for long time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, vntill Obedience com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, he did take nothing but bread and ſmall drinke; vnleſſe it were once or twiſe à weeke; and then in ſuch manner, that if he could, he would put ashes or duſt into it: but aboue all; it is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, how piouſly he ſpent his time; for you should neuer find him, but either at his study, or elſe in vocall or mentall prayer; and to talke with him of other matters, was out of his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and notwithſtanding that alwayes he was imployed in exteriour offices of the houſe;
<pb facs="tcp:152298:8"/> Reading both Diuinitie, and Philoſophie, hearing confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſsions; viſiting the ſicke, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the poore: ſometimes till 10. 11. or 12. à clocke at night: yet ſcarce would he be abſent from the Quire at midnight; or àny other office of the Quire at any time: In fine none can better expreſſe his great deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of gaining ſoules, and obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning martyrdome; than he himſelfe who felt the burning fire of his zeale, which he hath manifeſted in his owne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; which in time conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient shalbe put to the preſſe: briefly, he was ſingular in his auſteritie; rare in his pietie, exceſsiue in his zeale, moſt
<pb facs="tcp:152298:9"/> humble in his owne conceit: yet as learned in the eies of all that knew him. I cannot let paſſe the laſt paſſage, which I and many more did marke in him: that although he was much retired, and ſeldome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of any thing, vnleſſe he were vrged, for that he tooke no content in company: yet at the time when he had gotten leaue to goe into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; he was ſo much alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and changed, as if he had bene another man, or as one who was not able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine his ioy, but in actions, voice ad countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce one might iudge what his heart poſſeſſed: and ſo after a moſt austere, peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,
<pb facs="tcp:152298:9"/> and humble life; much admired, eſteemed and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all: he did offer vp a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie ſacrifice of his life for Gods cauſe; that he might reape an eternall crowne in heauen; which as we piouſly belieue, and may gather out of his owne writings; he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the mediation of our B. Lady: to whom he was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly devoted, and from whom he had receiued many favours.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Father Francis Bell</hi> (who was formerly Confeſſour to your Religious women of the third Order, Guardian of your Convent aforeſaid, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall of Scotland: and a
<pb facs="tcp:152298:10"/> little before his death againe elected Guardian of your ſaid Convent of Douay) I neede ſay no more than, what each one that knew him would ſay, that he was a <hi>true Franciſcan,</hi> or <hi>child of our holy Father S. Francis,</hi> &amp; that conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly he was fitting fuell, to ſatisfie the burning rage of Gods enemies: and to make a pleaſant holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſt to God, by ſacrificing his life for his ſake. Here I may apply the example of that famous Captaine <hi>Epimanon-das,</hi> who did not ſo much glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his great victories, as that his parents, from whom he had his being, did take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and content therein: as
<pb facs="tcp:152298:10"/> Plutarch reporteth. I for my part (and I belieue ſuch is the opinion of all your children whom you haue begotten in Chriſt Ieſus) doe not ſo much rejoice for the great glorie that redounds to our Province here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; as that you the Father of vs all, with pleaſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent haue ſeene the fruict of your labours,</p>
            <p>If Dutie may challenge it, ſure it muſt be yours by all right: for whatſoeuer we doe, is yours: you R. Father being our firſt Father, and vnder God the ſole beginner and worker of our being in this happy ſtate of Religion: for if Vliſſes was iudged to haue right to the
<pb facs="tcp:152298:11"/> Armour of Achilles, becauſe he was the occaſion of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the wars of Troy, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you may challenge whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer act praiſe-worthy may be performed by any of vs: and therfore if any haue deſerved praiſe, in labouring for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of ſoules, in teaching &amp; inſtructing others, in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in vertuous examples or any other heroicke acts, they are yours; and are but ſo many additions to your Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
            <p>If gratitude for benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued may moue me: who can better deſerue it, than your R. Paternitie? who by your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour haue ſuſtained, maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He glorious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle S. Paule writing to the Epheſians cap. 4. would haue them to be carefull <hi>ſeruare vnitatem ſpiritus in vinculo pacis</hi> to keepe vnitie of ſpirit, that is, mutuall charitie which proceeds fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152298:19"/> in the bond of peace; which, makes vs to be one body, and all members of one head Chriſt Ieſus, by whom we become one ſpirit, each one liuing by one and the ſelfe ſame ſpirit which giueth to each ſpirituall life and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as we are called in one hope of our vocation to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, immortalitie and celestiall glorie. For to all there is <hi>vnus Dominus, vnafides, vnum baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> one lord, one faith, one baptiſme: wherein all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152298:19"/> doe agree, and make vp that Church whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein alone is ſaluation, and which is one in three reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects as <hi>Aluarus Pelagius</hi> in his book of the Churches co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint <hi>de planctu Eccl. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 63. well noteth. Firſt the Church is one, ſaith he <hi>vnitate totalitatis,</hi> by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of totalitie becauſe it is a whole body compacted of diuers parts which are the faithfull: ſecondly <hi>vnitate conformitatis</hi> by vnitie of conformity, becauſe in each
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152298:20"/> part there is a kind of ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formitie, to wit in the gifts of grace, as in faith, hope, charitie, and good workes proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: thirdly <hi>vnitate attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butionis</hi> by vnitie of attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, for all the faith full haue a reference to the ſame end, which is ſaluation and eternall bliſſe, by a certaine attribution to Chriſt, who is the head of all thoſe that are to be ſaued.</p>
            <p>Theſe three vnities are aptly repreſented in the
<pb facs="tcp:152298:20"/> aforeſaid words. <hi>Vnum corpus</hi> one body ſhewes the integritie of Gods church; <hi>vnus ſpiritus</hi> one ſpirit the thing wherein all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full haue an aſsimilation and conformitie; and <hi>vnus Dominus</hi> one lord the principall and chiefe of all, whereto all haue attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or reſpect. So that in the Catholicke church, and amongſt all Catholicke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuers there is one Faith, becauſe one doctrine, from whence none without errour
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152298:21"/> may ſwarue; one Hope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all haue the ſame end; one Charitie, which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in all; and conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the ſelfe ſame precepts, ſacraments, and ſuch like without any difference or diſcord.</p>
            <p>Now although ſuch be the vnitie or vnion of the Catholicke Church, yet we may find in it a three fold pleaſing diuerſitie, which the foreſaid <hi>Aluarus</hi> alſo noted, The firſt is diuerſitie of degrees, ſome ſuperiour,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152298:21"/> ſome inferiour, which much conduceth to its dignitie and beauty; for as S. Bernard ſaith, <hi>Diſcretio virtuti or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem ponit, ordo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum tribuit, &amp; decorem. &amp; perpetuitatem.</hi> Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence giues order to vertue, order giues meaſure, beauty and perpetuitie. The ſecond is diuerſitie of offices, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diuerſe actions and functions of each one in the Church; And this the Apoſtle mentioneth Rom.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152298:22"/> 12. <hi>habentes donatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſecundum gratiam quae data eſt nobis diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes,</hi> hauing different gifts according to the grace that is giuen vs. The third is diuerſitie of ſtates, as ſome are more perfect than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>ſtella differt à ſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la in claritate Cor.</hi> 15. one starre differs from another in glory; ſome being inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pients or beginners, ſome proficients, who haue made progreſſe in vertue, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152298:22"/> perfect, ſome in one thing, ſome in another, all which maketh for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter embellishment of Gods Church. So that we may well ſay with the Pſalmiſt <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. <hi>Aſtitit Regina à dextris tuis in veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu deaurato, circundata varietate.</hi> The Queene on thy right hand in golden rayment, compaſſed with varietie; that is, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth on the right hand of God who will
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152298:23"/> alwayes by his mightie hand protect it, firme in faith, purified by tribulations and perſecutions, as gold by fire; with variety of ſtars, as clergy, laity, and diuers ſort of Religious orders.</p>
            <p>Who although they be in the vnion of Gods Church, all of them being true members therof, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing alſo conformitie with other members of the ſame in precepts, ſacraments, and ſuch like neceſſarie meanes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152298:23"/> of ſaluation, as faith, hope, and charitie; yet by à ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall emulation 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. they purſue the better gifts, and deſire more perfectly to follow our ſauiour Christ Ieſus, according to the Rules which God hath ordayned for the greater beauty of his Church, which by diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of Rules and inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s giues food for each palate, all tending to one and the ſelfe ſame end of making ſoules more perfect and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152298:24"/> to God. Amongst the reſt our holy Father S. <hi>Francis</hi> by the inſpiration of God hath ordayned three Rules. The two firſt haue bene explicated, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and expounded by very many: the third, as it was ordayned by our holy Father, hath not wanted expoſitors, but as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, hath beene very little touched or handled. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the greater ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152298:24"/> of thoſe who do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, or hereafter may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe this Rule, I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured to explicate and expound it, aſwell by she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing its dignitie, as alſo by ſetting downe the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſenſe, profit, and vſe that our Religious may make of their Rule: which taske I haue deuided into two parts; In the first I ſet downe ſome particular que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions for the better explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the title and other

Neither doth God require at our hands, that we should obſerue to fulfill all things that he hath propounded vnto vs in the Goſpell, vnleſſe it be in a ready and prompt mind, to doe whatſoeuer shall be agreable to his holy will and pleaſure (which no ſtate of perfection can iuſtly exclude) but to ſome he giueth fiue talents, to ſome two, and to ſome one, deuiding his graces as he pleaſes, to each one meanes to traffique withall, &amp; to make the good merchandiſe of life &amp; glory celeſtiall: as it may be ſeene in all ages. For in the old law he gaue different rules or lawes to the leuites, and to the other tribes; In the new law he

He shewed them the perfect forme of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, taught them humilitie, and exhorted them to patience, and willingly to endure tribulations and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he earneſtly and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended vnto them po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:152298:34"/> becauſe he brought the monkes that were diſperſed vnto an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie, giuing them a certaine forme or Rule of life. <hi>Pachomius</hi> after him gaue them a Rule which an Angel dictated vnto him, where with he made ſuch happy progreſſe, that in short time he aſſembled together 7000. mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes. In the ſame time liued the holy Abbot <hi>Simphoranus,</hi> who built a Monaſtery without the towne of Millan, whither he retired with many diſciples, to whom he gaue a Rule. The like alſo many others haue done, but the holy Church hath only admitted of foure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall whereon depend all other Rules, as on the foure cardinal vertues all other inferiour vertues do depend. Or we may ſay that there are but foure Rules, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there be but foure princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152298:34"/> Patriarkes of Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the Rule of <hi>S. Baſil,</hi> who was the firſt that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the monkes to make a vow after the yeare of probation or tryall, to remaine in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, and promiſe entire o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to their ſuperiours, vowing alſo chaſtitie, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, and in this reſpect it is ſaid to be the firſt Rule of all others, becauſe he firſt brought the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious to make a ſolemne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; he builded in Armenia a very great Monaſterie, wherein there remained more than 3000. Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes. This order doth flourish as yet in ſome parts of Greece, and Italy; all the regulars of the Eaſterne parts doe liue vnder this Rule, as alſo the Carmelites, with others.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is that of. <hi>S Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:152298:35"/> vnder which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Antony, and the Crouciers, although there be ſome difference in their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and habits.</p>
               <p>The third is that of <hi>S. Benedict,</hi> who hauing gathered together all the ſcattered monkes in Italie, and brought them to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine called Caſſin, the chiefe place of this Order, gaue them a Rule which they and their ſucceſſours were to obſerue, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which Rule doe militate all the blacke monkes to the great benefit of Gods Church, and conuerſion of many Countries, and in particular of our poore Country of England, which with iuſt reaſon ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:152298:35"/> them for its Patrons and Apoſtles. To this Rule, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to this Order, according to ſome, we may reduce that holy order of Charter Monkes, who obſerue a moſt ſtrict and auſtere life, according to the preſcription of their ſtatutes. The like may be ſaid of the Ieſuits, who liuing by certaine ſtatutes appropriated for their manner of liuing, may be put vnder this holy Patriarke, vnleſſe you will range them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſtanderd of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> oppoſite enemie to Heretickes, as they are.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt is that of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> who beeing one day amongſt others in S. Damians Church, kneeling before a Crucifix, heard a voice that ſaid vnto him <hi>Franciſce repara domum meam,</hi> Francis goe repaire my houſe, which thou ſeeſt ready

So that <hi>S. Francis</hi> may truly be called patriarke of the Mendicants. He would haue his children called Minors, in teſtimonie of their great humilitie, the progreſſe of whoſe order all the whole world admires. Haueing briefely ſpoken of the Rules that haue beene made for Religious men, the nature of our ſubiect requires
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:152298:36"/> that we doe as much for Religious woemen.</p>

And as in all ages and times there haue beene religious men, ſo haue there beene Religious and holy woemen: for if you find a <hi>Marke</hi> to begin the monkes in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt, there will not be wanting a <hi>Martha</hi> to begin the Nunnes at Marſiles: and <hi>S.

               <p>And, not tediouſly to proſecute all things, as our holy Father <hi>S. Francis</hi> did beginne the profeſſion of ſtrict pouerty, ſo there were many deuout woemen that would imitate his example, amongſt whome the firſt was the bleſſed virgin <hi>S. Clare</hi> from whom comes

               </head>
               <p>THe holy Church ſingeth in the office of <hi>S. Francis. Tres ordines hic ordinat, primumque fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum nominat Minorum, pauperum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que fit dominarum medius, ſed pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentium tertius ſexum capit v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trumque</hi> That is to ſay, This Sainct by diuine inſpiration ordayned three orders, the firſt he named the order of Friar Minours, the ſecond or middle is of the poore ladies or poore Clares, but the third of penitents doth compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend both ſexes. For When this holy Father had made a Rule for his brothers, and obtayned
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:152298:39"/> a confirmation thereof, he made a ſecond Rule which he gaue to Saint <hi>Clare</hi> in moſt things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the firſt Rule; but afterward hauing authoritie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope to preach pennance, the Friars being then called Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of penance, and hauing a particular reuelation from God, that it was his will he should labour for the conuerſion of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he went forth with ſuch feruour to put Gods will in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, that whole villages and townes were almoſt void of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, all of them deſiring to forſake the world, and doe pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for their ſinnes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he was forced to giue them ſome ſatisfaction by preſcribing vnto them a certaine Rule, forme, or manner of life, which Rule is commonly called the third Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, becauſe it is the third di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:152298:40"/> Rule he made: or the Rule of the third order, becauſe it is a third diſtinct order from the other two, called alſo the order of Penitentes, becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours thereof are to doe pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for their ſinnes And this admits all ſorts and ſexes; for as pennance is the common way for all to goe to heauen, ſo this Rule or order is common to all, admitting both clergy and laitie, virgin and married of both ſex: the fruite whereof the chapters following will shew.</p>
               <p>From hence comes that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cuſtome almoſt in all other orders, as in that of <hi>S. Dominicke</hi> as S.

               <p>ALthough we haue ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>S. Francis</hi> was the firſt author and beginner of this Rule, yet becauſe ſome ſeeme to make a doubt hereof, attributing it to Pope Nicholas the fourth, I could not paſſe on, vntill I had remoued this ſcruple. True it is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152298:41"/> that Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> did make it more publicke, and more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall by inſerting it in his bull giuen in the yeare 1289. ſome threeſcore and eight yeares after <hi>S. Francis</hi> had begun it, but that was onely to confirme not to inſtitute the Rule. The teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of <hi>S. Bonauenture</hi> may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice herein, vho in the 4. chapter of the life of <hi>S. Francis</hi> ſaith, that many of both ſexes enflamed by the feruour of his preachings did ſerue God in coniugall chaſtitie, according to the Rule which the man of God had giuen them. The ancient forme of profeſſion infinuates as much, <hi>I Brother N. doe vow &amp;c. to obſerue the Commandements of God all the time of my life, and conueniently to ſatiſfie for the tranſgreſsions or faults, which I shall commit againſt this Rule and manner of liuing of</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:152298:41"/> 
                  <hi>the third Order of Pennance, inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by S. Francis and confirmed by Pope Nicholas</hi> &amp;c. This forme is taken out of the booke called <hi>firmamentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trium ordinum,</hi> whence <hi>Bernardinus de Buſtis</hi> a famous preacher had good reaſon to ſay, that the Inuentors of this Rule were not Friar minors, nor any Bishop, nor Doctor nor any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, but the ſeraphicall Father <hi>S. Francis,</hi> the holy ghoſt teaching him, hath ordayned it. Which alſo is confirmed by the words of the ſaid Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who writing to the bishop of Florence in the yeare 1291. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids any one to moleſt, or trouble the Brothers of the third order of pennance, to whom, ſaith he, we haue giuen a forme of liuing, as it hath bene giuen by <hi>S. Francis,</hi> cauſing it to be noted by our Bull, to the end that the Brothers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:152298:42"/> not doubtfull, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the obſeruance of their life. <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. hath almoſt the ſame. Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 7. in his bull <hi>Ad vberes fructus</hi> in the yeare 1526. hath it more plainely; his words are theſe. And although the Rule of pennance inſtituted by <hi>S. Francis</hi> and approued by <hi>Nicholas</hi> our predeceſſour &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it ſeemes very vnli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely, that this order ſo much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, &amp; multiplied through the whole world, wherein there haue beene euen in the very beginning Emperours, and Empreſſes, kings and queenes, Bishops and prieſts, Doctours and illuſtrious perſons of all ſorts, should not haue a Rule, whereby they might direct their life. To this we may adde, what is recorded in the life of B. <hi>Lucheſius</hi> one of the firſt of this order, namely that he demanded
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:152298:42"/> a <hi>Rule</hi> of the holy Father S. Francis, who granted him his requeſt, and gaue him the habit. Alſo in the life of <hi>S. Viridane</hi> we read that our holy Father gaue her the habit, and inſtructing her left her a Rule to liue by in her ſolitude, wherein she liued many yeares. And who can doubt, but Bleſſed <hi>S. Elizabeth</hi> of Hungary had ſome certaine Rule whereof she made profeſſion. Wherfore it being certaine, that our holy Father inſtituted this Rule, it ſeemes neceſſarie to enquire of the diuerſitie of the Profeſſours thereof; as alſo how it hath made that progreſſe to perfection as now we ſee it is come vnto.</p>

               <p>THe feruent ſpirit of our holy Father S. <hi>Francis</hi> by his preaching of pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nance tooke ſuch effect, that it ſeemed he had ſet the whole world on fire with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming loue of God, which did not ſtay only in thoſe parts where he preached, but alſo did extend it ſelfe ouer the whole vniuerſe. There is no place, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, citie, towne or village where this fire hath not taken hold, there is no degree, qualitie, or ſex that hath not felt it, but in ſeuerall manner according to the ſubiect it lighted vpon.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:152298:43"/>
               <p>In ſome it had not that effect to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leaue their families, and goods, but enioying their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall eſtates they would ſerue God vnder this Rule and Order, amongſt which their haue bene Bishops who haue not eſteemed it to derogate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to weare the habit and cord of Bleſſed S. <hi>Francis,</hi> yea ſome Popes, cardinals, and eccleſiaſticall men of all ſorts. For confirmation whereof I will produce the words of the renowned and moſt eminent Cardinall <hi>Treio</hi> in his deuout and learned Epiſtle to the R. Fa. <hi>Luke Wadding</hi> (whoſe fame is diuulged through the whole world by his learned Annals which he hath made of our Order) who hath inſerted it in his deuout commentaries, which he hath made on the workes of our Holy Father,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152298:44"/> wherein the ſaid Cardinall hath many things in the praiſe of our ſeraphicall Order, and comming to this third Order thus expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulateth.</p>
               <p>Doe you admire and deſire to celebrate my praiſe, for that after the purple of Cardinall dignitie I haue put on the habit of the third Order, and profeſſed the third Rule of our Fa. <hi>S. Francis!</hi> but how can I, who profeſſe my life and all I haue to be of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> exhibite any ſigne of deuotion, vnleſſe I conſecrate or deuote my ſelf to his Religion. What is the girdle of S. <hi>Francis</hi> vnbeſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to girt the regal purple? <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wis</hi> king of France, and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> princeſſe of Hungary now num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongſt the Saints were girt with it, empreſſes, kings, quee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and other princes whoſe number this yeare at the time of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:152298:44"/> his death by moſt deuoutly receiuing the habit <hi>Philip</hi> the 3. king of Spaine did encreaſe, as alſo <hi>Elizabeth</hi> queene of Spaine wife to <hi>Philip</hi> the 4. and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Marie</hi> ſiſter of the ſame Philip the 4. gaue their names to this Religion. Perhaps the cilice doth not become the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all dignitie? certainely it doth, and in the time of <hi>Elizeus</hi> the prophet, the ſacred hiſtorie doth tell that the king of Iſrael did vſe it. Wherefore then doe you admire, that a Cardinall should put vpon his purple a cinericious habit, and gird himſelfe with a cord. You ſay it is a habit too humble for ſuch a dignitie. But I anſwere, therefore it is to be taken in this time &amp;c. What therfore should I doe, when I am eleuated to ſo ſupreme a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie in the Church, but defend
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:152298:45"/> my ſelfe with the humility of S. <hi>Francis</hi> whereby I may more ſecurely beare the labours and burthen of my enioyned charge. But what more? is not the cine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricious or ashy coloured habit of S. <hi>Francis</hi> truly purple, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Royall and Cardinall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie may be adorned? it is truely purple, which the bloud of Chriſt hath coloured and the faith of his paſſion ſigned, and which in Chriſts place <hi>S. Francis</hi> hath made redde with his proper bloud flowing from his ſtigmats. Is the humilitie of Chriſt a ſeruitude? that is not ſeruile which doth nobilitate the Royall purple. If any one should contemne, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre this habit, let him conſider that it is not gray but purple; for humilitie vnder taken for Chriſt doth carry with it a Royall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie. What therefore haue I
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:152298:45"/> done? I haue couered purple with purple, and that of a Cardinall with a kingly one. It is ſo farre from humbling me, that I may doubt whether I am become prouder thereby. Thus farre the foreſaid Cardinall. Whence we may gather that this Order is ſutable to Popes and Cardinals, kings and princes, and other of what condition ſoeuer they be, and this day in Spaine nothing more frequent, almoſt whole townes being of this Order.</p>
               <p>There are other ſorts of the third order, both me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and woemen who are taken either in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents of Friar Minors, or Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of S. <hi>Clare,</hi> or 'of other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions that liue vnder the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Friar Minors; in other Orders they are called Donats, becauſe they giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the ſeruice of ſuch a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:152298:46"/> houſe, and Oblates becauſe offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to ſuch an end: theſe make only ſimple vowes. There are others, whom the fire of diuine loue hath cauſed to leaue the world, and liue in communitie vnder ſolemne vowes of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, pouertie, and chaſtitie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing this Rule of the 3. Order, not barely as it was made by the ſeraphicall Father <hi>S. Francis,</hi> but as it is accomodated to their ſtate by ſeuerall Popes as we shall shew hereafter. Some of theſe doe addict themſelues to the keeping of Hoſpitals, teaching of children, ſeruing the ſicke, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Finally there be ſome, that to make a compleat religious ſtate, haue ioyned certaine ſtatutes to their Rule, for the better at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to perfection, and doe adde the fourth vow of Encloſure. Of

               <p>I pray God that the like doe not happen to this third Order, which hitherto contrary to the ordinary courſe hath dayly more and more encreaſed, not only in number but alſo in perfection, and from a low shrubbe is become a faire and beautifull tree, from the loweſt ſtate in Gods Church to be equall in a manner with the

                  <hi>hungary</hi> (as <hi>Iodocus Chlictouaeus</hi> reporteth) made a formall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of this Rule, and did take a gray poore patched habit, and girt her ſelfe with a rude cord, going alwayes barefoot, ſpending the reſt of her dayes in a moſt auſtere manner with ſome of her ladies cloathed in the ſame habit, and profeſſed in the ſame Order. Which, as it ſeemes, was the firſt communitie that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated vnder this Rule. After this the moſt pious <hi>Angela</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe of <hi>Ciuitella,</hi> hauing gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together many noble virgins at Fulginea (which is a towne ſome twelue miles diſtant from Aſſiſium) did build a couent vnder the title of S.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:152298:49"/> death, as is to be ſeene hereafter in her life.

Pope <hi>Bonifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> the 8. doth affirme that many monaſteries were begunne in Germany wher to he gaue many priuiledges which belong only to religious orders, as chapples and oratories, as is to be ſeene in <hi>F.

Nay before this neare Florence there were many communities wherto our holy Father gaue a Rule, it is very likely that ſome of theſe did make the ſolemne vowes, but whether they did or no makes not much to our purpoſe: at leaſt it shewes how this Order hath

               <p>And we shall find it alwayes to be abbettered, for <hi>Sixtus.</hi> 4. in the yeare 1480. in his Breue, <hi>Ad Chriſti Vicarij,</hi> hath theſe words.

               <p>The firſt is required, becauſe Religion is ſaid to haue an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable condition of life, and to carrie with it a ſtable perfection, which made S. <hi>Thomas</hi> 2. 2. q. 184. ar. 8. to preferre it before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degrees inferiour to Bishops, giuing this reaſon, becauſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is a permanent and vnchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable ſtate, whence Religion is called <hi>Ciuitas Dei</hi> the city of God.

               <p>The ſecond is required, not that the eſſence of Religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand without it, but becauſe the Church doth not ordinarily approue of any Religious order without ſome particular Rule, and from hence it is called <hi>Domus ſapientiae</hi> the houſe of wiſdome, <hi>Exerciti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The third, to wit, the ſolemne
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:152298:52"/> vowes of chaſtitie, pouertie, and obedience are eſſentially requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for by Religion one doth conſecrate and dedicate himſelfe wholy to God, which is perfectly done by thoſe three vowes. And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence Religion is called ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Baptiſme, the bath of ſoules, <hi>cella aromatum, argenti &amp; auri, &amp; odoramentorum, &amp; vnguenti opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi.

               <p>The laſt is requiſite to make it a ſecure, certaine, and ſpirituall ſtate. Neither was euer any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Order inſtituted without
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:152298:53"/> the approbation of the Church, not that the Popes haue alwayes done it, for in ancient time it was ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that they were approued by Bishops, but in the Laterane generall Councell it was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnder paine of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication that any new Religion should beginne without expreſſe approbation of the Pope, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone, as by many other councells it hath beene decreed, belongs the approbation, confirmation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Rules or Religious orders, ſo that now it is abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely neceſſarie, that the Pope doe giue his approbation, otherwiſe it would not be eſteemed a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſtate.</p>
               <p>Now theſe foure are to be found in the profeſſours of this third Order, and therfore none can doubt but that they are truely
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:152298:53"/> and properly Religious; for firſt their ſtate is permanent and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, no way allowing any one to goe backe againe to the world. Secondly they haue a particular Rule, as hath beene manifeſted before. Thirdly they make the ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne vowes of obedience, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, and pouertie, as may be ſeene in their forme of Profeſſion. And laſtly their Rule, ſtate, and Profeſſion is approued by the Church. For ſome twenty Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes haue confirmed and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Rule, and <hi>Sixtus</hi> 4. in the yeare 1480. <hi>Ad Chriſti Vicarij</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares their vowes to be ſolemne, and to haue all the effects that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſolemne vowes haue, as that none can leaue the Order, and that matrimonie made by them is of no force, and that they are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to diſſolue matrimonie that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:152298:54"/> is not conſummated. <hi>Innocentius the</hi> 8. hath confirmed the ſame, and ſo hath <hi>Leo the</hi> 10. <hi>Clement the</hi> 7. <hi>and Pius</hi> 5. which two haue made more ample declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Rule. So that no man can doubt but that the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of this Rule are truely Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and that they enioy all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges that other Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons haue.

               <head>THE TWELFTH CHAPTER. <hi>To whom the religious of this order are ſubiect.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT being certaine that euery true Religions man by force and nature of his ſtate is ſubiect to ſome higher power, which not only conſiſts in gouerning and ruling their ſubiects, but alſo in iuriſdiction, for no man can be truly Religious, vnleſſe He be lawfully receiued in the name of the Church, which requires a ſpirituall iuriſdiction in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer, who may admit of them punish them, and ſuch like. The queſtion therfore is, in whom remaines this ſuperiour power to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:152298:56"/> doe the fore ſaid things.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it is certaine that ſetting aſide exemptions, all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious are ſubiect to the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Bishops, in whoſe territorie or dioceſſe their houſes are, for the Bishop is Paſtour of the whole flocke reſiding in his dioceſſe. So that the exemptions, which now all Religious enioy, be nothing elfe but a freedome from the power and iuriſdiction, whereto formerly by nature of their ſtate and law of the Church they were ſubiect, which can be done by none but by the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Paſtour of the Churh, who alone can limite and ſtreigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the power and iuriſdiction of Bishops For although the power and authority of Bishops be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and as they ſay, of the diuine law, yet it is extended to their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:152298:57"/> dependently vpon <hi>S. Peter</hi> and his ſucceſſours, from whom iuriſdiction ouer ſuch and ſuch ſubiects is deriued: ſo that the Pope without all queſtion can modifie, mitigate, limite, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their power, as he shall iudge conuenient, and requiſite for the good of Gods Church. And from him alone, Haue beene granted to religious, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions, partly out of the great loue and deuotion, that many Popes haue borne to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and partly to take, away many iniurious abuſes that by the continuall iarres of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie did creepe into the Church, but principally for foure reaſons, to wit for the greater vniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Religion, neceſſitie of their ſtate, alleuiation or eaſing of the bishops burden, and the more exact gouernement of Religious
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:152298:57"/> perſons.</p>
               <p>Nothing is more neceſſarie in Religion than vniformitie, which vnder the ordinaries could hardly be obſerued; for each Dioceſſe hath its ſeuerall cuſtomes and lawes, and theſe Religious orders being diſperſed through whole kingdomes in all places of the world, should haue thereby a ſeuerall manner of liuing. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore Popes haue thought it more reaſonable, that they should be ſubiect to ſuperiours who with as much vniformitie as may be might gouerne them in all parts of the world, that ſo there may be no confuſion amongſt them.</p>
               <p>As for the neceſſity of there ſtate ſince no Bishop hath power out of his Dioceſſe to ſend forth any, for to preach, it is neceſſary that thoſe orders that haue care and charge of preaching and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:152298:58"/> teaching for the conuerſion of indfidels and heretickes, should haue ſome power to put this in execution, and to ſend thoſe that are ſitting for ſuch imployments without dependence of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries, whoſe authoritie doth not extend it ſelfe ſo farre. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome will ſay, that this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie might be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Bishops, I admit it, but they doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the great inconuenience that would come thereby, for ſuppoſing the bishop of this Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe ſend ſome one or two, the bishop of the next Dioceſſe one or two more to the ſame place, and ſo the like of others; either theſe muſt liue as ſtrangers one to another, which is contrary to their inſtitution, or elſe they muſt liue in communitie toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then who shall be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152298:58"/> to gouerne them. Any one that hath the leaſt experience in matters of Religion, may iudge what inconuenience may come thereby.</p>
               <p>Few perhaps doe conſider the third reaſon, vntill they feele the burden; How ſoeuer all will ſay, that the ordinaties are hereby freed from many troubles and difficulties of conſcience, for it were a thing morally impoſſible that the Bishop could by himſelfe attend to all Religious perſons, or viſite all Religious houſes, and therfore he muſt neceſſarily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt the charge to others who perhaps careleſsly, or not ſo v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prightly would performe that charge, and ſome times not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the ſtate of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious perſons they were to viſit or gouerne, would cauſe many relaxations.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:152298:59"/>
               <p>Wherfore for the better and more ſecure gouernement, it hath beene ordayned that each order should be gouerned by ſuperiours of their owne order, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true ſtate and manner of liuing might keepe them in a v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niforme manner of life, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine lawes fitting for ſuch a ſtate. For practicall experience more auaileth for the aduancement of any good gouernement, than ſpeculatiue knowledge drawen from bookes without practiſe, and yet this is the moſt that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily thoſe that are not of the ſame order haue. For this reaſon no doubt, Bleſſed S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> founder of the holy Societie of Ieſus not lauing begunne any order of woemen, becauſe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was principally to preach and teach, did particularly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, that none of his should
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:152298:59"/> take charge and care of Nunnes, well knowing that diuerſitie of ſpirits might cauſe diuerſity of inſtructions, and conſequently as many if not more confuſions and ſo he would that euery one should looke to his owne charge and the sheepe be left to their owne paſtours.</p>
               <p>For ſuch and many other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons haue Popes exempted moſt Religious orders from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement and iuriſdiction of Bishops. As in particular they haue donde to our order, for <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> 3. who approued our Rule did exempt both the Franciſcans and Dominicans from epiſcopall iuriſdiction, <hi>Innocentius</hi> 4. did it more amply, with many other. And that this third order is alſo exempted, is manifeſt by what hath beene ſaid in the precedent
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:152298:60"/> chapter; for if it enioyeth all the priuiledges of the firſt order, it muſt neceſſarily alſo enioy this exemption which is an eſpeciall priuiledge, much tending to the good of their order. Beſides di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe Popes haue wholy ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and the order of the poore clares to the gouernement of the Friar Minors, as may be ſeene in the Bulles of Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the 5. <hi>Sixtus.</hi> 4. <hi>Leo</hi> 10. <hi>Clement.</hi> 7. with many others, as is to be ſeene in the Bullarie of <hi>Roderiques.</hi> Yea <hi>Clement</hi> the 7. doth extend this grace to their houſes, monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Churches Prelats, ſeruants, men, and woemen, benefactors, perſons, ſubſtance, and goods whatſoeuer granting them to vſe and enioy all and ſingular the exemptions, priuiledges, immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, prerogatiues, indulgences,

So that we may well ſay that of Num. cap. 24. <hi>O quam pulchra tabernacula tua Iacob,</hi> How beautifull are thy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles ô Iacob, and thy tents ô Iſraell: as wooddie vallies as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered gardens beſides the Riuers, as tabernacles which our lord hath pitched, as cedars by the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:152298:64"/> waterſide. O how beautifull are the ſeuerall congregations milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnder the tents or Rules of the ſeraphicall Father S. <hi>Francis,</hi> they are like to wooddy vallies extending themſelues through the whole world, which like ſtrong bulwarkes are to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the treacheries and deceits of the Diuell: for as he euery day vſeth new inuentions to deceiue and deuoure ſoules, ſo theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders yeeld new ſouldiours day ly to vanquish and tread him vnder foot; no ſoouer doth one troupe begin to faile but another riſes vp. And therfore they may well be compared to watered garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s beſides the Riuers, alwayes florishing, and in due time gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing copious fruicts, amongſt whome by a pious kinde of emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation the true worship of God
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:152298:65"/> and religious pietie dayly encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. And according as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe ſo they are more and more ſtrengthned, being alſo as taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles which our lord hath pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, that is ſolide and firme, as being erected and eſtablished by God, who hath adorned each member and branche of them with ſeuerall giſts and graces, conformable to their capacity. This camot chooſe but be a great ornament and ſplendour to the Church, proceeding from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of theſe cedars by the water ſide who being watered with the water of grace doe bring forth fruit in abundance.</p>
               <p>Truly it is a thing worthy to be noted, that in the ſole order of <hi>S. Francis</hi> there is meat for all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, none can excuſe themſelues, of weakeneſſe none can preſume
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:152298:65"/> of their ſtrength. For amongſt the profeſſours of this order or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>S.

                     <hi>What this ſainct did vntill ſuch time as she was married.</hi> §. 1.</head>
                  <p>OMitting the deſcription of her noble race (for she was daughter to the king of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary) and the prophecy reported to haue beene made before the world enioyed ſo rare a piece, of her birth, name, wit, miracles, and many, ſuch like things worthy enough of recording; I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne at the 7. yeare of her age, when she begins to shew forth the luſtre of her future ſanctitie. For euen now before she well knowes what vertue is, she is become the mirrour and patterne, of vertue, eſpecially of patience and charitie. For although her infancy principally in the more tender ſex might excuſe her griefe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:152298:67"/> for her mothers death, yet she then aboue her age and ſex, tooke it with a conſtant patience, and with a patient charity, not any waies ſeeking to reuenge her deare mother, but ſweetly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eing for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who had iniuriouſely take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away her life. And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce forward you should find the little child alwayes in the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome Altar or other, now proſtrating her ſelfe in a moſt pious manner, now kneeling for a long ſpace together, with eies and hands lifted vp to heauen, and if she could not get into the Church, ſweetly kneeling at the doore, kiſſeing the threshold, doores and walles of that holy place.</p>
                  <p>As she encreased in yeares ſo she encreaſed in pietie, making a happy progreſſe in all vertues,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:152298:68"/> and begins now to lay ſolide grounds of a ſpirituall life. For at the 9. yeare of her age, she begins to haue God alwayes before her eies, and for his ſake to deſpiſe, contemne, and caſt of ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of apparell, the pleaſures of the flesh, and vanity of the world. Now she preſcribes to her ſelfe certaine prayers which she reſolued dayly to make, and if she chanced in the day time to be hindred (as ſeldome she was, becauſe true deuotion will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes find occaſion) that her defect would she ſupply in the night. Aboue all other ſaints next to our Bleſſed lady she made choiſe of <hi>S. Iohn Euangeliſt</hi> for her patron, hauing firſt made her prayer to God, that she might chooſe one who should moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance her pious deſires: him she loued, and reuerenced ſo
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:152298:68"/> much, that she would neuer deny any thing that was demanded for his ſake.</p>
                  <p>Shee moſt religiouſly obſerued the ſolemnities of feaſts and holy dayes, and whereas according to the vanitie of the world others adorne and decke themſelues with gay apparell, shee on thoſe dayes would take away ſome thing of her ordinary attire, well knowing that it was more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God to haue the minde adorned with vertues, than the body with rich apparell, and that a ſoule addicted to the ſtudie of religious pietie is more acceptable to him, than the corporall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance shining with purple, gold, ſiluer, iewels or pretious ſtones, which are but as the droſſe of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Although she were but yet a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:152298:69"/> child, yet tooke she no delight in childish toyes, and playes, and if by chance she were compelled to daunce, she vſed ſuch tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance therein, that she rather did manifeſt her ciuility in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plieing to their deſires, than any content she had in the recreation. She carried her ſelfe indifferent in all ſuch things, and ſo by a quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian and dayly excerciſe reſiſted her naturall inclinations, and mortified her appetite alwayes declining from the libertie of a looſe life, she did raiſe vp her ſelfe to greater meanes of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Entring into the Church she would alwayes lay aſide her crowne, vntill ſuch time as all being done she were admonished to returne, for that she thought it a great impietie that her head should there be adorned with the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:152298:69"/> proude pompe of a glittering crowne, where was repreſented vnto her the head of our ſauiour crowned with pricking thornes. Who could expect ſuch deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſuch high vertues in ſo tender yeares. It ſeemed to many (and not without reaſon) that she was more fitting to liue amongſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious woemen, than in the court; you would iudge that she had beene ſome Angel in humaine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eſpecially where as ſo many occaſions of wordly ſenſuality were preſented vnto her, as all knowe the courts of Princes be ſubiect to.</p>

                  <p>IN the fourteenth yeare of her age she is forced by the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:152298:70"/> she owed to her Father to marry, and thereby perhaps muſt mitigate ſomewhat of this great feruour. But nothing leſſe; for her heart was firme and ſtable in thoſe graces that God had giuen her, more and more sheweing forth her feruour of ſpirit, dayly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in the ſtudy of vertuous actions, feeding her minde with the contemplation of celeſtiall things, and excerciſeing her body in watchings, prayers, and faſts, oftentimes cautiouſly riſeing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her huſbands ſide in the night to pray. And when she could get op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, she would lie on the bare ground, and to preuent all rebellion of the flesh, she chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her tender body euery fryday with diſciplines, &amp; in the lent of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener. Vnder her ſilkes and ſattins she ware continually a haireshirt,

                  <p>To all this we may adde her great charitie, wherein she ſpent the greater part of her time, now labouring by word and workes to draw others to amendment of life, by reaſon whereof many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies forſooke the vanitie of the world, ſome by her counſell ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keing vowes of chaſtitie, others entering into religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, others who had not receiued the faith by her good counſell and inſtruction brought to be baptized, she her ſelfe going to be their God-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the font. Other whiles going forth to viſit poore ſicke woemen, comforting and cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing them with all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, which she alwayes brought
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:152298:71"/> with her. And indeed she was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes-mercifull to the poore, not diſdaining ſecretly to dreſſe their fores and botches, yea their ſcald-heads and ſcurfes, where of being ſometimes reprehended she ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully anſwered, that she had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleaſe Chriſt than me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And to auoid idleneſſe the mother of all miſchiefe, being vacant from the aforeſaid works of piety she vſed with her maydes to ſpinne, and therewithall she cloathed the poore. And that her charitie might neuer ceaſe, she cauſed a faire hoſpitall to be built, wherein she gaue order that all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie should be prouided for the poore that were weake and ſick, which hoſpitall (although it were on a high mountaine ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what painfull to aſcend) she did ordinarily viſit euery day, going with great humilitie to each one
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:152298:71"/> that was there, enquiring whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they wanted any thing, or what they deſired, and with her owne hands did feed thoſe that were not able to helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, taking them out of their beds, bearing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in her armes, and compoſeing their beds for them. Moſt louingly would she embrace the poore little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, carrieing them in her armes, and shewing her tender affection to them, as if she had beene their mother: ſo that ordinarily she was called the Mother of the poore. She neuer regarded their defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, diſeaſes, ſcabs or filth, but louingly receiued all as if they had beene her owne. In this hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall she had alwayes 28 perſons for whom she prouided, although she were forced ſometimes for their ſakes to ſubſtract neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:152298:72"/> from her ſelfe. Beſides there were 900. beggars daily nouriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed by her almes; but aboue all she tooke ſpeciall care for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls and burials of ſuch poore people as were not able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Theſe acts of ſo notable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity God almighty shewed both to be gratefull to himſelfe, and alſo not preiudiciall to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands ſtate; as the following ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples will shew. For once being much importuned by ſome poore people for almes, and hauing not any other thing to giue, she gaue them her mantell which was very rich, which the Prince miſſeing asked for it, the Sainct confidently anſwered that it hung thereby, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience did verify. At another time the prince being in great anxietie
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:152298:72"/> of mind, for that she had not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell beſeeming her qualitie, eſpecially in ſuch a time as there came vnto him an Embaſſadour from the king her Father, she willed him not to be troubled, for that she did neuer care for ſuch vanities; But the time being come, that she muſt deſcend to the Embaſſadour, loe she appeares in very rich apparell, adorned with ſuch beauty that euery one was ſtrucke into admiration, eſpecially the prince, to whom dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the reaſon she ſmiling ſaid, our lord doth know how to prepare ſuch things when he pleaſeth. About the yeare 1225. there fell a great dearth through the whole country, when her husband being abroade she ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers all the corne she could get, and moſt bountifully imparts it
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:152298:73"/> to the poore, ſo that she emptied all the princes barnes, and ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, which notwith ſtanding were found to be as they were before.</p>
                  <p>It is too hard to expreſſe her great deuotion at Maſſe and other diuine offices, her feruent and pious aſpirations, her pietie in the time of communion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein she was many times ſeene to shine with a great light and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtneſſe. And although she ſpent her whole time very religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet more particularly she obſerued the lent with faſtings, almes, and prayers, adding fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent diſciplines; and on maundy thirſday poorely clad she viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the churches, washing with great deuotion the feet of twelue poore woemen, and after ward gaue them liberall almes. Shee

                  <p>The fame of theſe and ſuch like vertues came to the eares of our ſeraphicall <hi>S.

The ſame was alſo manifeſted to the ſaint by a very rare miracle, for being one day walking with her gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly Father called <hi>Br.

Whence Pope <hi>Gregorie the</hi> 9. hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the fame of her vertues, writ to her, takeing her as his daughter vnder the protection of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall See, and commending her to <hi>Conradus</hi> (a Friar as ſome will haue it) a very holy man, that he should inſtruct her what she was to doe, where with the Saint was much ſtrengthened and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, moſt willingly ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her ſelfe to his direction. <hi>Conradus</hi> then perſuaded her to the contempt of the world, and the following of Chriſt, which she very willing to doe, to the end she might execute it in ſome ſure and conſtant courſe of life,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:152298:78"/> she made choiſe of this order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> to liue accordingly in holy and euangelicall pouertie, which not without ſeeming re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctation her ghoſtly Father ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, eſpecially ſeeing her ſo earneſtly &amp; with teares to beg it. And vpon a good Friday before the altar in the Friar minors Church, by a ſolemne profeſſion she renounced parents, children, pompes, and vanities of the world, and her proper will, to follow our Lord, but being about to giue away all her meanes <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radus</hi> would not permit it.</p>
                  <p>Not long after for the loue of her ghoſtly Father, that she might better enioy his good inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s she went to <hi>Marburge,</hi> where she began an hoſpitall, which by commandement of <hi>Pope Gregory the</hi> 9. she dedicated to <hi>S. Francis.</hi>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:152298:78"/> The Pope at that time ſent her ſome of the bloud, that flowed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſide of the ſaid ſaint when he was marked with the holy ſtigmats.</p>
                  <p>In this hoſpitall she aſpires to a higher kind of life, and with a ſpirituall emulation endeauours to imitate the Friar Minors in a noble contempt of all things, takeing their ſtate of life and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit as much as she could; as ſaith <hi>S. Bonauenture</hi> in a ſermon of this ſaint. She made profeſſion of the third order of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> as appeares in the Bull of her cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization, and renouncing the world had her haire cut of, and thence forward went barefoot, girding her ſelfe with a cord: the habit that she with two or three more did take, was gray, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and poore, whereby she
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:152298:79"/> embraced perfect continency, and voluntarie pouertie. The R. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Pelbartus</hi> in one of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons vpon this ſaint, ſaith that she contemned the world and entred into the third order of <hi>S. Francis</hi> to liue in chaſtitie, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſo ſtrict pouertie, that she did alwayes we are gray, and patched garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. Her father hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring she was come to ſo great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertie ſent for her by an earle, who when he ſaw her cried out <hi>Is this the king of Hungaries daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi> We may wel ſay, no: for she is now the beloued daughter of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> whoſe pouertie she imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates.</p>
                  <p>I muſt here, to auoid prolixity, omit her great charitie towards the poore in this place, her fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity, and benigne comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment towards her inferiours, as
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:152298:79"/> alſo her miracles. It is admirable to conſider her poore life, her pietie towards the ſicke, as alſo towards leapers (in whoſe forme Chriſt appeared once vnto her) which was not vnrewarded by almighty God, who by her prayers did heale very many of all manner of diſeaſes, aſwell cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall as ſpirituall. With ſuch and ſo great ſignes of vertue this ſaint was adorned that it is impoſſible to declare all. As she faithfully exerciſed the office of <hi>Martha,</hi> ſo ſhe omitted not the quiet reſt of <hi>Marie,</hi> when workes of pietie and domeſticall charge did ceaſe, then her ſpirit was moſt at worke, for then she goes to ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret place, and lifting vp her eies, hands, and heart to God, powers forth her prayer with feruent intention, and that with
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:152298:80"/> teares of compunction, wherein she had a ſingular grace. Neither was she vnexperienc't in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, for oftentimes she was rapt in extaſie for many houres together, wherein her face did appeare shining with admirable ſweetneſſe and luſtre, and at ſuch times not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed the colloquie of Angels, but alſo of Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe, compaſſed about with an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of ſaints, after which time being ſufficiently refreshed with ſpirituall food, she would taſt no corporall food for many dayes together.</p>
                  <p>But now the time drawing on, wherein she muſt poſſeſſe him eternally, he ioyfully appeared vnto her ſaying, <hi>veni electa mea, &amp; caelesti thalamo, quem tibi ab a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terno destinaui, potire.</hi> Come my

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:152298:81"/> teares. God permitted the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to appeare to her, but she with a conſtant minde cryed out, Fly ô miſerable that thou art, fly vnhappy one, thou haſt nothing to doe in me. And being in her laſt agonie she ſaid; This is the houre of the virginall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate birth of our Sauiour (for it was about midnight) admonishing her aſſiſtents to ſpeake ſomething of the moſt beautifill child <hi>Ieſus.</hi> How he was borne in winters night, and in anothers houſe, ſwadled in cloathes, placed in a manger, found of the sheapheards, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the ſtarre, and laſtly ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Chaldeans. Theſe, ſayd she, are the venerable miſteries, moſt rich benefits, and beautifull ornaments of our ſaluation. In theſe our hope taketh force, our
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:152298:81"/> faith doth profit vs, and our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie enflame vs. Of theſe I pray diſcourſe and ſweetly conferre. In which words she gaue vp the ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>What miracles God hath wrought by her, both paſt and future ages will teſtifie, what is ſayd may ſuffice for our purpoſe, Thoſe authors who with more eloquence haue deſcribed her life, can manifeſt at more lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure her innumerable miracles. Only I will note here that she left foure Images of our <hi>B.

Her prayers were not without fruit, for she obtained her deſire, in enioying ſo bleſſed an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, who at twelue years old was crowned king of France, yet remained vnder the protection of his mother, who would often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultate theſe words vnto him, <hi>My moſt deare ſonne, I had rather thou shouldeſt vndergoe a temporall death, than by one mortall ſinne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thy creatour.</hi> Which words
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:152298:84"/> tooke ſuch root in his mind, that Gods grace ſo preſeruing him he neuer ſinned mortally in his life, his mother ſtill inſtructing him in the way of vertue, and procureing alwayes ſome religious men, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Franciſcans and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans to be with him, that by their example he might be drawne to vertue and pietie.</p>
               <p>And being now of age fit for marriage she prouided a wife for him, to the great ioy and comfort of all his ſubiects, but for three nights after his marriage he ſtill continued in prayer, bridling his coniugall deſire with the feare of God, and euer after liued moſt chaſtly with his queene. Hee was greatly addicted vnto pietie and deuotion, daily ſaying the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall houres, and much loued humilitie, pouertie, charitie, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:152298:85"/> and other vertues, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyeing the workes of pennance, and mercy, liuing in watchings, prayers, faſtings, diſciplines, and haircloath, and continually medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateing on the ſacred miſteries of the Incarnation, and Paſſion of our Sauiour; the principall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereof he from all places procured, as that of the crowne of thornes, great part of the Croſſe, the Iron of the lance that opened our Sauiours ſide, with many others.</p>
               <p>He was very deuout in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Maſſe, and did communicate often, and that with ſuch deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he would allure others to pietie, ſo ſtrong in faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that being one time called to behold an apparition of a moſt beautifull child, when the prieſt did eleuate the holy Sacrament,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:152298:85"/> he refuſed to goe to ſee it, ſaying that ſuch ſignes were for thoſe that did not belieue.</p>
               <p>Out of his great zeale of Gods honour he went forth to make warre with the Sarazens, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein at the firſt he properouſly proceeded, but in the end, God ſo willing, he was taken priſoner, but by compoſition being ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in his returne God by his prayer deliuered both himſelfe and his company from ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke. And as in this he shewed his feruent deſire to reduce thoſe infidels to the light of faith, ſo he alwayes did defend the Church againſt its enemies, he loued and maintained all religious orders, eſpecially thoſe of the Friar mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and Preachers; but was a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere enemie to all heretickes, euen to the houre of his death,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:152298:86"/> for on his death bed it was one of his laſt and greateſt charges he gaue to his ſonne. <hi>Fili,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>fis deuotus &amp; obediens matri noſtrae Romanae Eccleſiae, &amp; ſummo Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fici tanquam Patri ſpirituali,</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout and obedient to our mother the Romane Church, and to the Soueraigne bishop as to a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Father.</p>
               <p>It is reported of him, that going in pilgrimage to Rome, he paſſed by Peruſia to ſee Brother <hi>Giles</hi> one of the companions of our holy Father, a man of great contemplation, who by reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnderſtanding of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and meeting the king in a diſguiſed habit (for he went in a pilgrimes weed) he preſently moſt ioyfully receiued him, and both falling proſtrate to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and both riſing together af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:152298:86"/> an houres ſpace they went one from another. Brother <hi>Giles</hi> being demanded why he did not ſpeake to the king ſith he knew him, he anſwered we ſaw one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers hearts ſo clearely, that it was not needfull to ſpeake any thing.</p>
               <p>Omitting many other moſt excellent things in his life, I will conclude with his death, which was thus. In the yeare 1270. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued all the Sacraments of the Church with great deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and caſting himſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate on the ground with a haire-cloath and ashes vnder him, holding his hands ſtretched forth in the forme of a Croſſe, he gaue vp the Ghoſt, and afterward shined with many miracles, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of curing the diſeaſe commonly called the kings Euill,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:152298:87"/> and as ſome will haue it, from him all the ſucceeding kings haue that vertue. For the great vertues and miracles that God wrought by this ſaint, he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſed by <hi>Pope Bonifacius the</hi> 8. in the yeare 1298. And that he was of this third order is manifeſt by all the ancient monuments of our order, the whole order ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing alwayes celebrated his feaſt with peculiar right. And <hi>Paulus</hi> 3. in his Bull <hi>Cum à nobis petitur.</hi> 1547. numbers him amongſt the ſaincts of this third order. See the Martirologe of the Friar Minors on the 25. of Auguſt.</p>

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:152298:88"/> made the Archdeane of Rhemes to chooſe him for to be his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, which office he performed with great applauſe. He euer cherished the poore, helped or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, and comforted thoſe that were in any affliction, he was a great peacemaker, neuer giuing ſentence or iudgement but with teares accompanying it: as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to diſpleaſe any one.</p>
               <p>In all things he did shew his great charitie to the poore and ſingular loue to God, for whoſe ſake he deſpiſed all the things of this world. Which that he might more perfectly effect, he tooke the habit of this third order, which humble ſtate made him to leaue his office or place, (although now he were officiall to the Bishop) and retire himſelfe to a poore little Parish Church, where with
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:152298:88"/> more freedome he might be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue to diuine contemplation. And now going in his poore habit, vnder which alſo he did weare a hairshirt, with moſt ſtrict faſts euen in bread and water, very frequently did remaine in extaſie, and ſometimes for the ſpace of ſeauen dayes together. He celebrated Maſſe with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great deuotion, as alſo the diuine office, which he ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at midnight, very ſparing in ſleepe, ſeldome or neuer compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeing himſelfe thereto, vnleſſe by reading, labouring, preaching, or ſuch like he was forced to it, and then in his habit, on the ground, taking for his pillow the Bible or ſome ſtone.</p>
               <p>His great hoſpitalitie was the cauſe that his table neuer wanted gueſſe, and thoſe principally of

               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all this, beſides his continuall preachings with great fruit, he neuer omitted the quiet peace of minde, but addicted himſelfe to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>platio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherein he was often viſited by Angels, by whome he had many things reuealed vnto him, and at laſt his owne death, whereto he prepared himſelfe with great deuotion, and with the generall opinion of ſanctitie confirmed afterwards by miracles.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:152298:91"/> and nailes which doe continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grow, which the religious woemen of the monaſterie where her body lies doe cut of, turning her body vp and downe without any derriment; and which is more miraculous in the yeare 1357. her tombe and all things that were in the chappell where the tombe was, yea the habit vpon her backe were conſumed with fire, which was ſo vehement that it melted the rings from her finger without doing the leaſt hurt to the holy body.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed <hi>S. Margaret of Cortona</hi> was very beautifull &amp; had beene giuen to wantonneſſe, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to God, and lamenting her former life she began to deſpiſe all vanities, and carnall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and with effuſion of teares did implore the mercy of God,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:152298:91"/> applying her ſelfe to good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, eſpecially of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſionating the poore, and out of her great deſire to lead a penitentiall life, she humbly begged the habit of the third order, which was denyed her for three yeares ſpace, aſwell in conſideration of her former life, as yongneſſe of yeares, but perſeuering in her firme purpoſe she obtained it at length in the yeare 1277. at <hi>Cortona,</hi> and began a new life, which was to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired; for chooſing a ſolitarie place she addicted her ſelfe wholly to abſtinencies, faſtings, diſciplines, watchings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall prayer, lyeing on the ground, hauing a ſtone for her pillow. She went in a poore and humble habit, being full of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and pittie to the poore, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſubſtracting from her
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:152298:92"/> ſelfe to giue to them. And by the continuall meditation of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Sauiour she obtained the gift of compunction, weeping very frequently aſwell for her owne ſinnes, as alſo for the ſinnes of others. She was oftentimes troubled by the Diuell appearing to her in diuers formes, but was as often co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted by our Sauiour, by our Bleſſed lady, and by the holy angels, and ſtrengthened by their celeſtiall viſitations; which made her as much to shine in moſt profound humilitie, and high pouertie, as in the loue of Chriſt: whereby she was often rapt in extaſies, and had many reuelations, whilſt she applyed her minde to the contemplation of diuine things. By the ſpirit of prophecy she did foretell things to come, and reueale the ſecrets
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:152298:92"/> of many hearts and conſciences, being very famous both in life and after her death for many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, euen to this our time, which made <hi>Pope vrbane the</hi> 8. that now is, in the yeare 1623. to put her in the number of the Beatified, and to giue licence that the diuine office might be made of her through the whole order of <hi>S. Francis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this order alſo was that great contemplatiue bleſſed <hi>S. Angela</hi> who in this penitentiall habit did vndertake a wonderfull ſtrict way of pennance, wherein she was conſolated by celeſtiall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Being much giuen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, for twelue yeares ſpace she tooke no other food than the Bleſſed ſacrament. Her body remaines at <hi>Fulginea</hi> whole and entire. She hath left behinde
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:152298:93"/> her many excellent things, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the ordinary capacitie of men which are extant in lattin, Italian, ſpanish, and French, and are to be deſired in our vulgar la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage, if I doe it not (as I much deſire to doe) I pray God to raiſe ſome one that will performe it, as a worke very neceſſary for all religious perſons, thoſe principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who ſeeke the way of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation as this ſaint did.</p>
               <p>I omit to ſpeake of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beatified ſaincts, as of <hi>S. Conradus,</hi> whoſe office is ſerued in the whole order, and of <hi>S. Roch</hi> who is held as a canonized ſaint through the whole Church, with many others. I will now ſet downe briefly a catalogue of the principall religious woemen, who haue beene famous for ſanctitie and miracles in this order accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               <p>ALthough there haue beene from the beginning of this holy order many that did liue in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:152298:94"/> a clauſtrall manner, the order it ſelfe euery day encreaſing more and more, &amp; yeelding abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of holy perſons, who haue profeſſed this holy rule, yet it neuer came to its full perfection, that is, to compleat and perfect ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, vntill the time of bleſſed <hi>Angeline,</hi> (a diminitiue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For hauing gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether many noble yong woemen of the ſame minde with her ſelfe, shee built a monaſterie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated it to <hi>S. Anne</hi> in the yeare 1397. and entring therein with her aſſociats, hauing firſt made the three vowes of obedience, pouerty, and chaſtitie she did with ſanctitie perſeuer to the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:152298:94"/> end of her life in faſting, prayer, and other exerciſes of pennance. By her example many other ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering their meanes together in short time did build eight mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries in diuerſe parts of Italy, and did liue vnder the habit and rule of the third order, which manner of life was approued and confirmed by the Popes <hi>Martin.</hi> 5 <hi>Eugenius</hi> 4. Not long after by their example many men did alſo build conuents liuing vnder the ſame habit and rule, with the three vowes of religion as they had done. This holy woman died on the day that Chriſt was borne, as our Sauiour appearing on <hi>S. Thomas</hi> his day had declared vnto her; and lies buried in the ſaid monaſtery of <hi>S. Anne</hi> where she is worshipped with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of the people.</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:152298:95"/>
               <p>Amongſt the diſciples of this holy woman were many reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons famous for ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie, <hi>Iacobellus</hi> principally notes three: to wit, bleſſed <hi>Onuphria,</hi> ſometimes counteſſe of Aprutia, and <hi>B. Francis of Burgaria,</hi> of the houſe of the Earles of Marſican, and bleſſed <hi>Ioane of Fulginea,</hi> much renowned for pietie, vertue, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular obſeruance, and perfection of life, who afterward went to Florence, and there built the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie of <hi>S. Onuphrius,</hi> ending their daies in great ſanctitie.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed <hi>Margaret Dominicke</hi> was alſo one of them that tooke the habit from <hi>S. Angeline,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a perfect follower of her vertues, for she much excelled in prayer, humilitie, and conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of her ſelfe, and did ſerue euery one as if she had beene their ſubiect,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:152298:95"/> and with a ſincere heart and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dide mind did reuerence all her ſiſters; her puritie was rather an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall than humane, and her obedience ſuch that without the conſent of her ſuperiour she would doe or reſolue nothing, shewing no leſſe reſpect alſo to her ghoſtly Father. She tamed her flesh with abſtinence, faſtings, and haircloath, as being moſt zealous of her vowes; being full of charitie, she did helpe any of her ſiſters that were in neceſſitie, and willingly performe their wills. In the end the monaſterie of <hi>S. Anne</hi> being ouer filled with religions, the citizens of Fulginea did build another vnder the title of <hi>S. Anne,</hi> and this holy woman was made Abbeſſe therof, where she inſtructed her ſiſters in the beſt manner, and by her friends
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:152298:96"/> enlarged the monaſtery, which she moſt religiouſly gouerned, vntill she was called to Spoletum, where she began alſo another monaſterie, vnder the title of <hi>S. Catharine.</hi> Which done she was brought home to herformer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie, where she appeared more feruent, excerciſing her ſelfe in the workes of holy prayer, pennance, and mortification, whence after the death of <hi>B. S. Angeline</hi> she was called to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in her place, and therein began to shine with miracles, and there died with incredible patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in her infirmitie, her body was placed in a shrine neere to the altar in the ſaid monaſterie of <hi>S. Anne,</hi> which was long times after found whole, and entire, yeelding a moſt fragrant odour, and shining with miracles.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:152298:96"/>
               <p>Bleſſed <hi>Lucida</hi> was one of the companions of <hi>S. Magaret,</hi> famous for regular obſeruance and rare vertues. She was much delighted in the memorie of Chriſts Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and thereby merited to feele the dolour of the wounds of our Sauiour in her hands.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed <hi>Sanctia Martinez</hi> was endowed with great humilitie and perfection of life. For after she had builded at her owne charges the monaſterie of <hi>S. Elizabeth</hi> at Arenali in the yeare 1440. and laid a good foundation for the reuenues thereof became her ſelfe religious of this order, being of ſuch examplar life, that all did ſtriue to imitate her humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, being ſuch that although she was borne of nobler parents, yet was she not ashamed to carry water vpon her shoulders through
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:152298:97"/> the market place. And no leſſe addicted she her ſelfe to auſteritie and pennance, and ſo died with great opinion of ſanctitie.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed <hi>Pyrona of fla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders</hi> did enter into the monaſterie of the third order in Ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that there she might ſerue God more purely, and more freely giue her ſelfe to workes of pennance. She had the gift of compunction ſo copiouſly, that her eies were as a red cloth. She was very obedient to her ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, flourished in true pouertie, and did much labour to conſerue her chaſtitie and keepe her mind and body free from all ſpot. After she had liued thus a long time with great ſanctitie she got leaue of her Abbeſſe to goe and liue in an hermitage within the Church yard of <hi>S. Nicholas,</hi> neere to the towne, where she did shine with
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:152298:97"/> admirable ſanctitie, auſteritie of life, patience, and miracles, and knew the ſecret thoughts of the mindes of thoſe that came to her, and oftentimes made them knowne. She died in the yeare 1472.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed <hi>Mary Ruiz of Alcarazio</hi> deſpiſeing all nuptiall rites tooke the habit of this order, and by her example did draw many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to her, and together with them by the authoritie of Pope <hi>Innocent the</hi> 8. did liue after a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious manner, changeing her houſe into a monaſterie in the yeare 1486. And liuing vnder the obedience of the Prouinciall of the Friar Minors, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of merits and vertues, moſt religiouſly died hauing before foretold the time of her death.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time liued
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:152298:98"/> Bleſſed <hi>Beatrix Hermoſilla</hi> who together with her Ant did ſtudy to perfection, nothing eſteeming the world and pompe therof, whatſoeuer they could get, they did diſtribute to the poore, and by their labours with helpe of the citizens did erect the mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of <hi>S. Elizabeth</hi> in Caſtile, where with other virgins and woemen they made profeſſion of this third order, and with great ſanctitie of life liued and died therein, in the yeare 1485. Her bones were taken vp 47. yeares after, being fresh, and yeelding a very ſweet ſent, and being tranſlated to a more conuenient place very many miracles were wrought before them, which gaue occaſion to the people to shew great deuotion vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>B. Aldonza Lopetia</hi> of noble
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:152298:98"/> race, by the helpe of the cittizens of Arenali in the yeare 1490. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the monaſterie of our lady, after wards through the ſanctitie of the holy woeman called the monaſterie of Aldonza, for that she was the firſt Abbeſſe of this houſe, who had the ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, working miracles both in her life and after her death.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed <hi>Vraca Roderiguez of Vlmes</hi> of moſt noble parentage, and exceeding rich, entring into a a Church where she heard the words of our Sauiour, <hi>ſi vis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus eſſe, vade &amp; vende omnia quae habes, &amp; da pauperibus,</hi> tooke them as ſaid to her ſelfe, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed much part of her meanes vpon religious houſes, builded an hoſpitall, conuerting her owne houſe into a monaſterie, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all the reſt to the poore. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:152298:99"/> she with fiue of her neeces, and three other gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woemen entred into this order about the yeare 1491. None was more chaſt than she, none more vigilant. She exceld all the reſt in patience, meekeneſſe, mercie, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, and dayly labours, and at laſt replenished with merits, and ſanctitie died, &amp; lies buried in the monaſterie she had erected.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time liued Bleſſed <hi>Agnes à ferro</hi> who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time did attend on the Queene of Aragonia, but afterward being weary of the world, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeing the vaine honours thereof, became religious of this third or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, liuing in great pouertie, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, and ſanctitie.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1500. Bleſſed <hi>Anne of Areualo</hi> was famous for ſanctitie in the monaſterie of <hi>S. Elizabeth,</hi> of the third order of <hi>S.</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:152298:99"/> 
                  <hi>Francis,</hi> where she liued for a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares in exceeding great humilitie, patience, abſtinence, prayer, and charitie.</p>
               <p>About the ſame yeare liued Bleſſed <hi>Clare of Fulginea</hi> famous for pietie, and deuotion, being very zealous of regular obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance, and often deſeruing to be comforted in apparitions by the ſeraphicall Father <hi>S. Francis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the yeare 1515. florished Bleſſed <hi>Catharine Ruiz,</hi> whoſe charitie in aſſiſting the ſicke ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters was admirable, ſpending all that euer she could get for them, yea begging for them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by became famous for ſanctitie.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed <hi>Anna Sanchez</hi> was one of her companions, whoſe deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and continuall prayer was much to be admired, yet she was of an excellent prudence for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:152298:100"/> and therfore was ſent to be mother or Abbeſſe in the Cloyſter of S. <hi>Clement</hi> from whence after she had beene there 20. yeares with great labours and toiles, leauing the moſt fragrant odour of her ſweet conuerſation she returned to her former place, where broken and wearied with pennances, faſtings, and continuall prayers, she died with great ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie, the cell and bed wherein she died, did for ſometime after shine with a great light to the great admiration of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time alſo liued in Placentia Bleſſed <hi>Baptiſta</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in her life for many vertues, and after her death for many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, eſpecially for that her body remaining entire doth yeeld a moſt ſweet and pleaſing ſmell.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1519. liued <hi>B. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:152298:100"/> 
                  <hi>Pennaloſa</hi> in the monaſterie of <hi>S. Elizabeth</hi> in Segouia, a woman of a very religious ſpirit, in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, prayer, and charitie hardly to be equaliſed, who as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reported, in her life time did obtaine life for a yong man that was dead, for which and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things she is worshipped there with great deuotion.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time B. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Pontia</hi> together with her two daughters, both alſo holy woemen began the monaſterie of S. <hi>Anne</hi> in the prouince of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, and by their example did draw many others to Religion. And as in their life they had the generall opinion of ſanctitie, ſo after their death their Reliques haue deliuered many that had beene poſſeſſed, as alſo cured ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed Franciſca of S. <hi>Anne</hi> in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:152298:101"/> the yeare 1525. was brought from the monaſterie where she had made profeſſion of the third or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to the monaſterie of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation at Grinion, in the dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of Toledo, that she might giue a beginning therto, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct others that were to come in regular diſcipline; and as she had beene abbeſſe of the former place, ſo was she abbeſſe of this with wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfull fruit of ſoules; for she did excell in prudence, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, pietie, humilitie, affabilitie, modeſtie, abſtinence, and mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall obſeruance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>B. Lucie</hi> about the yeare 1530. did found the monaſterie of S. <hi>Clare</hi> vnder the rule of the third order, and was very famous for perfection of life and miracles. Her body is had in great eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the faithfull in thoſe parts.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:152298:101"/>
               <p>About this time liued Bleſſed <hi>S. Ioane</hi> of the holy Croſſe, whoſe admirable life is ſet forth in out vulgar language, and therefore here omitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>B. Francis</hi> liued in the ſame time of whom <hi>Gonzaga</hi> thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. This moſt vertuous and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſiſter <hi>Francis</hi> was a child of the third order of ſaint <hi>Francis,</hi> who declining from the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable deceits of the fiend, did get a glorious victorie ouer ſathan, and therefore was much feared by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>B. Aldonza</hi> about the yeare 1566. was famous for ſanctitie, and after hauing beene abbeſſe, when the ſiſters were to remoue, she prayed that she might die in the ſame place, which she obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſix yeares after her death her body was found whole and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:152298:102"/> entire, yeelding a fragrant odour, wherefore she was held in great veneration.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed <hi>Marie Gonſalue</hi> in the yeare 1577. died with great opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſanctitie, after she had fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a monaſterie of this third or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, wherein she lead a life of great perfection, aſwell in ſeruing the poore as in compaſſionating their miſeries and wants, she did alwayes ſleep without any bed vnder her, exactly obſeruing the faſts of the whole yeare with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and bloudy diſciplines.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed <hi>Olalia Grineſia</hi> was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for ſanctitie about the yeare 1583. For entring into this order, and therein deſiring the height of pennance, she was not contented with the ordinary auſterities of her order, but inuented new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings all the lents and vigils, in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:152298:102"/> bread and water, and three times in the weeke did take bloudy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines; being much addicted to pouertie, and humilitie, she would willingly ſerue all, and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did meditate on our lords Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and not without teares. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly falling into a dropſy, now fourſcore yeares old she died moſt bleſſedly. The ſiſters by her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques did cure very many diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time liued <hi>B.

This Bleſſed virgin of noble parents in Cicilie, from her infancy gaue her ſelfe to pietie, vertue, and temperance, obſeruing the faſts very ſtrictly, and deſpiſeing the pompe and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of this world, out of her great deſire of perfection entred into this third order, giuing very good example of humilitie, pouertie, chaſtitie, and obedience.

               <p>HAuing shewed before how this order began, and what
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:152298:104"/> progreſſe it hath made from time to time, it will be eaſy to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what the Pope did intend, when in the prologue of this Rule, he ſaith, <hi>But foraſmuch as by courſe of time through the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Ghost not only mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried perſons, and ſuch as dwell in the world, but alſo quires of innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable virgins, taking vpon them the three eſſentiall vowes, and alſo ſome of them that of encloſure, by our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie building very many mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, not without manifold fruit, and edification of the Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant, haue ſubdued their neckes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoake of the foreſaid third or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp;c.</hi> Which words haue beene occaſion that I haue produced ſome of the moſt famous woeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and virgins that haue beene in this order, the fame of their ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie hauing beene the reaſon &amp;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:152298:104"/> motiue of the abbreuiating, refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and accomodating of this Rule to religious perſons.</p>
               <p>For the Pope as Father of all Chriſtians, and particularly of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious perſons, by his office is to haue a care of the conſeruation, propagation, and encreaſe of Gods honour on all occaſions, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the familie is to prouide ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t meanes to ſatisfie the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of thoſe that be vnder his charge, therfore to him as to our iudge we are to haue recourſe in all doubts and difficulties, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his tribunal ſeat to receiue the finall ſentence, he alſo as ſuperiour is to giue vs lawes and precepts which we are to obſerue, as one that hath power from God to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all, in as much as tends to our ſoules good, and from him we receiue all rules with their
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:152298:105"/> approbation, declaration, and confirmation.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Leo</hi> in the prologue of this Rule, as a Father doth write to his ſonnes and daugthers of this order, putting them in mind, what intention they ought to haue in the obſeruance of this Rule, to wit to reduce themſelues in as much as the ſtate of this life will permit, to the ſame innocencie wherein man was created, and as a Father of a familie prouides for them competent meanes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that perfection, and like a Paſtour doth propound vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> true food of their ſoules, which ſtrengthens them in their hard courſe of life, and laſtly as a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame iudge to whom the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious of this order haue made their appeale, he ordaines lawes, and precepts, whereby they are
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:152298:105"/> to liue giuing them a rule acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to their ſtate.</p>
               <p>For the Pope ſeeing the great encreaſe of this order, out of his paſtorall care and great affection which he did beare to this order did renew, authenticate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and approue this rule, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting thoſe things that were not conformable to a religious ſtate, and making it more propre to deuout religious ſoules, leauing moſt ample ſcope to thoſe that are their ſuperiours or haue go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of them, to adde or ioyne any thing by ordinations, ſtatutes, or conſtitutions, that might tend to the better obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance of this rule, and aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the profeſſours thereof in the way of perfection. Which indeed is no ſmall dignitie and credit to this order, ſith the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:152298:106"/> paſtour and head of Gods Church hath vouchſafed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend ſo low, as to examine, conſider, compare, declare, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and approue their rule by his ſoueraigne authoritie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it vnto the world, as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruable iuſt, lawfull, and good. And to this rule ſuperiours euen by the Popes authoritie haue added certaine ſtatutes for their better gouernement in the way of perfection.</p>
               <p>From whence proceedeth that great diuerſitie and varietie in this third order. For although all of them acknowledge. <hi>S. Francis</hi> for their patrone, and militate vnder the ſame rule; yet the varietie of ſtatutes and manner of life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the diuerſitie of ſuperiours hath cauſed ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie in their habit and manner

               </head>
               <p>THe words of Pope <hi>Lea</hi> in the foreſaid prologue haue beene the ground of this queſtion. For he ſaith, that Pope <hi>Nicholas the</hi> 4. had confirmed and approued the third rule of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> which he tearmeth of pennance, by
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:152298:107"/> which the holy confeſſour of Chriſt full of Gods ſpirit labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to further the ſaluation of all faithfull Chriſtians. Some foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly haue taken occaſion hereat to derogate from this order, as if it were only for penitents or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentants, that had committed ſome great vice, but truely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were ſo, it would be ſo farre from diminishing the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme therof, that happy are thoſe who shall be amongſt thoſe true conuertes who are called penitents of <hi>S. Magdalen</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentants, who notwithſtanding are not of this order as may be ſeene in that which followes.</p>
               <p>Wherfore the word <hi>Pennance</hi> is taken diuerſly, ſometimes for the Sacrament of pennance, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metimes for ſatisfaction, as it is the third part of the Sacrament,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:152298:107"/> ſometimes for punishment of ſinne, ſometimes for interiour ſorrow, which is threefold, to witt, in habit, in act, and in paſſion that followes the act. Here in this place we take it as an act, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit of pennance, which is a morall vertue, whereby a ſinner deteſteth ſinne and labours to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid all the occaſions of ſinne, and thoſe that frequently vſe ſuch acts are ſaid to lead a penitentiall life. Such an one was that peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall king <hi>Dauid,</hi> who in a few words doth briefely explicate it, ſaying <hi>pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>Be yee angrie, and ſinne not, the things that you ſay in your hearts, and in your chambers, be yee ſorry for, ſacrifice yee the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Iustice.</hi> The royall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet hauing perſuaded all to leaue the vanitie of this world, and not to follow lies, shewes the way
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:152298:108"/> how they should doe it, firſt they muſt take a holy anger and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt ſinne, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the things of this world; ſecondly they muſt make a firme and reſolute purpoſe thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to a void all ſinne, euill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, vitious inclinations; and wicked ſuggeſtions of the Diuell, the world, and the flesh; and laſtly labour to doe well, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to God the iuſt and due ſacrifice of all their actions, the continuance whereof in diuers places of the pſalmes he inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, as when he ſaith, I haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in my ſighing, I will euery night wash my bed, I will water my couch with my teares; as if he should ſay, I will continually afflict my ſelfe with pennance, and will neuer ceaſe from this thought of my ſinnes, but night
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:152298:108"/> and day I will shed forth teares of compunction to wash away mine offences, I did eat ashes as bread and mingled my drinke with weeping. The prophet <hi>Ioel c.</hi> 2. inuites all to the ſame, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert imini ad me in toto corde, in ieiunio, &amp; in fletu, &amp; in planctu</hi> Be conuerted to me in all your heart, in faſting, and in weeping, and in mourming; that is, be ye conuerted to me your God by pennance with your whole heart, with all your ſoule, with all your ſpirit, with all your affection, which ye may beſt doe by faſting, whereby the ſinnes of the flesh and gluttonie are punished, and in weeping and mourning, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby with teares ye deplore your ingratitude towards your good God. This pennance was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced vnto vs by all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:152298:109"/> but in a more eminent manner declared and practiſed by that moſt holy forerunner of our Sauiour <hi>B. Saint Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> whoſe office was to preach pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by word and example; of whom S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie and ſtrict courſe of life of holy S. Iohn Baptiſt is a hard meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of eternall death vnto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and wanton perſons.</hi> And <hi>S. Chryſoſtome;</hi> The habit of his body might preach the vertues of his mind &amp;c. The Apoſtles tought the ſame. <hi>S. Iohn Climacus</hi> hath notable examples in this kind. The holy hermits that liued in the deſarts did shine with pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, alwaies leading a ſtrict penitentiall life. And to omit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite others, let one <hi>S. Francis</hi> ſerue for all, who after his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion did lead a moſt auſtere
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:152298:109"/> life of pennance. For putting on the armour of the Croſſe he did ſubdue all his ſenſuall appetites with ſuch rigour of diſcipline, that he ſcarce tooke what was neceſſarie for his ſuſtentation; for (ſaid he) it is hard to ſatisfie the neceſſities of the body, and not yeeld to ſenſuall inclination. And therfore being in health he did ſeldome eat any dreſſed meates, and when he did, he put to ashes or water for ſauce; and very ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely too taking water enough to ſuffice nature. He ſtill inuented new wayes to afflict his body, his bed being for the moſt part the ground or earth, his pillow a blocke or ſtone. With ſuch and many the like mortifications did he arme him ſelfe to conuert the whole world, and to draw it to pennance whereof he became a
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:152298:110"/> preacher both by word and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. And this is all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his ſermons tend vnto: let other ſaints and Doctours preach the high points of ſpeculatiue, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, or morall diuinitie; let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers abound in eloquence and fertile conceits of holy miſteries; let them teach the ſublime mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the holy Trinity, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther articles of our faith; let them explicate the ſublime gifts which God imparts to deuout ſoules, or other ſuch curious points; <hi>S. Francis</hi> hath but one ſermon of pennance, alwayes repeating and inculcating the ſame, after the example of <hi>S. Iohn Baptiſt</hi> and of his Maſter <hi>Chriſt Ieſus;</hi> knowes not how to ſpeake any other language; his text, exordium, narration, peroration or conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is of pennance, which he alwayes preaches, whilſt his very
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:152298:110"/> life is a continuated ſermon of penuance. The fruict whereof was ſuch, that the whole world would needs follow his example, which made him for the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all to make certaine rules of pennance. All the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, counſels, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of the firſt Rule ſauour of nothing elſe but pennance, and the profeſſours thereof, as wel noteth <hi>S. Bonauenture,</hi> were Preachers of Pennance. The ſecond rule of no leſſe auſteritie and pennance he gaue to the poore Clares. But this patriarcke of pennance had not thus giuen way and meanes to all, for ſome had not ſtrength and abilitie to vndertake ſuch rigorous auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who notwith ſtanding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by his example and words muſt needes take ſome rule and manner of life, that they might
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:152298:111"/> doe pennance for their ſinnes. And this rule or method of liueing did the holy Father ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish, calleing it the rule of pennance or order of penitents, ſo that the whole order of <hi>S. Francis</hi> is an order of pennance, and all his children are penitents, and thoſe that are not ſo, deſerue not to be eſteemed his diſciples. So that the firſt order in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning were called preachers of pennance, but afterward for the more humilitie the Saint would haue them called <hi>Friar Minors,</hi> a name of humilitie, dependence, and ſubmiſſion, which is the higheſt condition of a Friar minor. The vulgar people alſo ſtiled the now called poore Clares or poore dames, religious penitents: only the name of penitents remaines to the third
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:152298:111"/> order, whoſe rule is commonly called the rule of pennance, and their order ſtiled the order of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as here the Popes Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe entitles it.</p>

               <p>MY reader perhaps will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, why I propound this diſcourſe ſo farre differing from my ſubiect, but let him pleaſe to conſider that my intention is to explicate the things that are contayned in the prologue of the rule; which the Pope thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth. <hi>Among other things committed to our charge and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement,</hi>

               <p>As for the firſt, we cannot better declare it than by its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which principally were ſeauen; the firſt was wiſdome and perfect knowledge of all things; the ſecond grace, amitie or friendship with God: the third originall iuſtice; the fourth immortalitie and impaſſibilitie;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:152298:112"/> the fifth the inhabitation of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, where they might eat of the tree of life; the ſixth a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care that God had of them; the ſeauenth and laſt freedome from all luſt and concupiſcence. <hi>S. Bernard</hi> contemplating this ſtate of Innocency in his 35. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vpon Canticles ſaith, that Adam did dwell in the terreſtriall paradiſe, a place of more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyneſſe than any mortall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could deſire, his conuerſation was exempt from pouertie, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could diſcommodate him, he was recreated with odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant flowers, and delightfull fruicts, filled with honour and glory, and eſtablished or created prince of all creatures.</p>
               <p>This minion or fauorite of heauen was an abridegement of all perfection, a microcoſme
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:152298:113"/> where God had heaped all the exquiſite beauty that could be ſeene in heauen or in earth. For he had enriched him with grace, endowed him with immortalitie, and aboue all created him in ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall iuſtice, whereby he perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly poſſeſſed all naturall ſciences which to gether with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſupernaturall miſteries was infuſed into him at the time of his creation.</p>
               <p>Moreouer God had ranged all creatures vnder his obedience, all liuing beaſts did acknowledge him for their lord, all other things tending to his benefit, content, and pleaſure: the planets ſent forth no euill influences, each heauen, planet, and element containeing themſelues within the limits of their natures to the vſe of man. But that which
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:152298:113"/> excelles all is that man was made to the image and likeneſſe of God, that he might alwayes tend towards him and conforme himſelfe entirely to his holy will, nothing being ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him ſaue only God. So that beholding himſelfe he had occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to contemplate the maker of all things, and conſider the dignitie of his owne ſoule. To be briefe, Adam had ſuch great preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues in the ſtate of innocency, that he was alwayes vnited to God, his ſoule enriched with grace was pleaſing to God, his appetite without contradiction was ſubiect to the lawes of reaſon, his body should have beene alwayes vigorous and ſtrong. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Who is he that beholding this well carued image, is not rauished
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:152298:114"/> and aſtonished, or can refraine from extolling the honour and praiſe of the workeman? Who can behold ſo noble a creature, &amp; not magnify the Creatour who hath made man the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, the epitomie of the grand vniuerſe, the loue of heauen, the terrour of the diuell, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of angels, ſonne of God, and brother of Chriſt Ieſus! what shall I ſay more? It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to conceiue, much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to declare the preheminence, dignity, and nobility of man in the ſtate of Innocence, when as he was cloathed with that royall robe of originall iuſtice whereby man was ſubiect to God, all the inferiour powers to reaſon.

Therfore as by the offence of one vnto all men to condemnation, ſo alſo by the iustice of one, vnto all men to iuſtification of life.</hi> As if he should haue ſayd, If by the fault of Adam all his poſteritie did incurre the guilt &amp; paine of death, know that Chriſt hath exhibited a farre greater benefit; for Chriſt by his grace hath giuen vs greater gifts, than Adam by his ſinne hath taken from vs. For ſaith he <hi>not as the offence, ſo alſo the gift. For if by the offence of one many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift in the grace of one man Ieſus Chriſt hath abounded vpon many.</hi> As by Adam all were brought to perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:152298:118"/> ſo by Chriſt all were redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; by Adam all were ſubiected to punishment, by Chriſt all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered; by Adam all did looſe grace, by Chriſt all may receiue it after a more excellent manner; by Adam all came to dye tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, by Chriſt all may riſe to life eternall: by Adam all were brought to a corrupted ſtate, by Chriſt all may be eleuated to a more ſublime and ſpirituall ſtate: by Adam all were made like beaſtes, by Chriſt like Angels, yea aboue Angels: Adam depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs of the tree of life, Chriſt giues vs the bread of life: Adam depriued vs of originall Iuſtice, Chriſt giues vs plenty of grace equiualent to that originall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, yea farre ſurpaſſing, for although both be ſupernaturall gifts immediatly infuſed in the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:152298:119"/> ſoule, yet they differ in this that originall iuſtice did make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect peace betweene the faculties and powers of the ſoule, and grace doth make man pleaſing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God in order to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and by it man is made a ſonne of God, and heire of the kingdome of heauen. This grace of its owne nature is ſufficient to reduce vs to that former ſtate of innocence, and that in all reſpects, but that God in his infinite wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedome for diuerſe reaſons hath permitted to ſtand with grace many tribulations, and afflictions of this world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Augustine</hi> will giue vs the firſt reaſon hereof in his booke <hi>de pec. rem. c.</hi> 31. that we should not ſeeke after the Sacraments for temporall reſpects, but for the future glory, thereby to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:152298:119"/> exerciſe our faith, hope, patience and ſuch like; ſo that by the inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable mercy of God the paine of vice doth paſſe into armour of vertue, and the punishment of the ſinner is become the merit of the iuſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly God permits theſe temporall troubles to remaine, to put vs in mind of the greiuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the fault, for other wiſe we should ſcarce thinke of the ſinne that is ſo long paſt, when we are ſo vnmindfull of our owne ſinnes newly committed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly this is a worke of the diuine prouidence, to excite vs to the conſideration and ſearch of a better life exempt and free from all miſerie: for as experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, there is nothing more moues vs to ſeeke after celeſtiall things, than to conſider and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:152298:120"/> the miſeries of this world.</p>
               <p>Fourthly by the want of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall iuſtice we are put in mind of our frailtie, and how eaſily we may fall into ſinne</p>
               <p>Fiftly that the members may be like vnto their head <hi>Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> who notwithſtanding that he was replenished with all grace, would take vpon him our infirmities, and for our ſakes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſubiect to the law of death.</p>
               <p>For ſuch and the like reaſons, hath God permitted that man should not enioy that peace which in the ſtate of Innocence he poſſeſſed. But yet he hath fully ſupplied this defect, by enriching our ſoules with many graces and gifts, as virginity, patience, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, faſting, abſtinences, mortification, pouertie, obedience and ſuch like, which he by word
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:152298:120"/> and example hath left vs, to the end that we may attaine to a ſtate of Innocence equiualent to the former, and much exceeding it in merit; for by theſe vertues perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in grace we labour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in our ſoules that which by originall Iuſtice we might haue poſſeſſed, and conſequently thoſe that profeſſe the practiſe of the aforeſaid vertues, doe as much as lies in their power, endeauour to reduce themſelues to the ſtate of Innocence. Which made the Pope to ſay that the religious of this order, who by their rule and manner of life doe continually practiſe theſe vertues, haue their finall end of their profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce themſelues to the ſtate of innocence.

               <p>OVr ſeraphicall Doctour <hi>S. Bonauenture</hi> ſets downe fiue ſorts of perfection, to be found in Chriſtians. The firſt is common and neceſſarie to all Chriſtians, which he cals ſufficient perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, conſiſting in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the precepts. Of this our Sauiour ſpeaketh <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Eſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te perfecti, ſicut pater veſter caelestis perfectus eſt.</hi> Be yee perfect, as your heauenly father is perfect. The ſecond is perfection of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which conſiſts in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:152298:122"/> of the counſells, wherof it is ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. <hi>ſi vis perfectus eſſe, vade &amp; vende omnia quae ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes. &amp;c.</hi> If thou wilt be perfect, goe and ſell all thou haſt. The third is perfection of prelature, which conſiſts in the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſubiects, according to that of <hi>S. Luke c.</hi> 6. <hi>perfectus om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis erit, ſi ſit ſicut magiſter eius.</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one shall be perfect, if he be as is maſter; The fourth is perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of worke, which conſiſts in the oſtenſion of good examples, from whence Noe was ſaid to be perfect. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. <hi>Noe vir iuſtus fuit atque perfectus in generationibus ſuis.</hi> Noe was a iuſt and perfect man in his generations. The fift and laſt is perfection of tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, which conſiſts in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of the things that are beſt and moſt hard. According
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:152298:122"/> to that of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> 1. <hi>ep. c.</hi> 4. <hi>Perfecta charitas foras mittit timorem.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect charitie caſteth out feare.</p>
               <p>Now it is certaine that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious of this third order, as being Chriſtians and faithfull ſubiects of Gods Church, doe or ought to enioy the firſt perfection. For by their rule and profeſſion they are obliged punctually to obſerue the precepts, whereunto alſo they bind themſelues in a more ſtrict manner, as shall be declared in the ſecond part.</p>
               <p>The third perfection is proper to Bishops and prelats, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently cannot be appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any religious ſtate, which is only a ſtate of getting perfection, and therfore by ſome iudged to be the ſchoole wherein prelates might learne that perfection which they communicate to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:152298:123"/>
               <p>But the other three may be appropriated to a religious ſtate, which is no other but a ſtate of men or woemen tending to chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian perfection by the vowes of pouertie, chaſtitie, and obedience: or a certaine manner of life, bound by certaine lawes and cuſtomes, wherein perfection is acquired by obſeruance of the Euangelicall counſells, whereby the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours therof become perfect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and patternes of good life, whilſt they themſelues attaine to the chiefe perfection of tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and peace which vnites them to God.</p>
               <p>Amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt other approued orders in Gods Church this third order, as it is now accomodated for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons tends to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; for as it hath beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before, and will appeare
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:152298:123"/> more plainely in the expoſition of the rule, this third order is a ſtate of men or woemen tending to Chriſtian perfection by the three eſſentiall vowes of religion, and other obſeruances of Euangelicall counſells, and hath yeelded many illuſtrious perſons famous for ſanctitie and pietie, and indeed wholy tends to the perfection of tranquillitie and peace, as may be ſeene in the chapter following.</p>
               <p>This may be confirmed by the Popes who haue approued and confirmed this order to be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and in the ſtate of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>Martin the</hi> 5. <hi>Eugenius</hi> 4. in the yeare 1442. <hi>Nicholas</hi> 5. in the yeare 1447. <hi>Paulus</hi> 2. in the yeare 1459. <hi>Sixtus</hi> 4. in the yeare 1471. <hi>Iulius</hi> 2. in the yeare 1508. <hi>Leo</hi> 10. in the yeare 1517. 1521. <hi>Clemens</hi> 7. in the yeare 1526. <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>

And as ſuch they haue beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by all Chriſtian princes, who haue giuen them the ſame priuiledges which other religious haue.

               <p>THe angelicall Doctour <hi>S. Thomas</hi> deuides the life of a chriſtian into actiue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue, becauſe ſome men doe principally attend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, others to exteriour actions, alledging the authoritie of <hi>S. Gregory. hom</hi> 14. <hi>ſuper Ezech:</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Duae ſunt vitae in quibus nos omnipotens Deus per ſacrum eloquium erudit, actiua vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delicet &amp; contemplatiua.</hi> There be two liues ſaith he, wherein allmightly God doth inſtruct vs
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:152298:125"/> by his word, to wit actiue and contemplatiue.</p>
               <p>This laſt in it ſelfe and of its owne nature farre exceeds the other, which the foreſaid <hi>S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> proues by many reaſons, as that becauſe the contemplatiue life belongs to man according to his beſt part, to wit according to his vnderſtanding and will, for it principally conſiſts in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the ſoule, but the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue life is occupied about exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour things. Secondly, there is more delight in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue than in the actiue, whence <hi>S. Aug: ſer</hi> 26. <hi>de verbis Domini. Martha turbabatur, Maria Epu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labatur,</hi> Martha was troubled, Marie feaſted. Thirdly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue is to be loued for it ſelfe, but the actiue is ordained to ſome other end. Fourthly the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:152298:125"/> contemplatlue life is according to diuine things, but the actiue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to humaine. Whence. our Sauiour ſaid to <hi>Marie</hi> Luc. 10. <hi>Optimam parte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> elegit Maria, quae non auferetur ab ea.</hi> Marie hath choſen the beſt part which shall not be taken away from her. Which <hi>S. Auguſt</hi> ſer 27. in the place aboue cited, thus expoundeth; Thou <hi>Martha</hi> haſt not choſen an euill part, but she a better, becauſe it shall not be taken away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, but from thee ſometime shal be taken away the burden of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, the ſweetneſſe of truth or contemplation being eternall. And <hi>S. Baſill</hi> affirmeth, that by theſe two woemen are ſet before our eies two ſorts of life, the one of which is of inferiour note or eſteeme, becauſe occupied in the more groſſe operations of this
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:152298:126"/> life, and yet maruellouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable: wherfore if thou wilt ſerue with Martha, doe in the name of God, for Chriſt hath ſaid, what you shall doe to one of my little ones, that you doe to mee, whether you lodge ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, feed the poore, or be moued to compaſſion on the afflicted, our lord will repute all theſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices as if they were done to his owne perſon. But in another place the ſame Father doth high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extoll the contemplatiue life, ſaying that it is the ſchoole of celeſtiall doctrine, the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of diuine ſciences, where God is all that is learned, where God is the way by which we muſt goe, by him alone we muſt come to the knowledge of the ſoueraigne truth. So that the contemplatiue life is a continuall
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:152298:126"/> adheſion to God in ſpirit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby man becomes lord of the whole world hauing his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in heauen, &amp; there fixeing and placing his mind doth deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe all earthly things, whiles he eſteemes nothing good or great but God and diuine things, and here is his continuall pradiſe vnleſſe the law of charitie other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe require.</p>
               <p>Hence there be found amongſt religious orders three ſtates, ſome that giue themſelues to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue life, others that apply their minds wholy to the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and laſtly others that are partly contemplatiue and partly actiue, more or leſſe according to their ſeuerall conſtitutions. Of the firſt ſort are all thoſe orders of knights, who make profeſſion of ſeuerall exteriour acts, as to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:152298:127"/> defend the poore, or to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Turkes: as alſo all thoſe that giue themſelues to keepe hoſpitalls, redeeme captiues, and ſuch like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of the ſecond ſort, be all thoſe ancient hermits, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorits, and monkes, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all religious woemen who vow encloſure. For they lead a life truely angelicall, night and day ſeruing God in the quire, and applying their minds to their God in all their actions. Of the third and laſt are thoſe religious orders which are commonly called mendicants, who apply themſelues aſwell to the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue life, as to the actiue which proceeds from the contemplatiue, in preaching, teaching, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting of Nations.</p>
               <p>In this our third order of our holy Father <hi>S. Francis</hi> be found
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:152298:127"/> of all ſorts. For as it hath beene before declared, there be ſome of them that leade a pious kind of life in the world addicting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to godly excerciſes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, principally of penance whereof they make profeſſion, and ſome others doe liue in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, and giue themſelues to ſerue the ſicke, keepe hoſpitalls, lodge the poore, and ſuch like, all which no doubt doe follow the actiue way, others there be that giue themſelues purely to the contemplatiue way, and ſuch are thoſe religious woemen of this order as make vow of Encloſure, for their whole life hath no other end but to ſerue and loue God, as shall more amply be declared in the expoſition of their rule. Laſtly there are ſome that enioy a mixt life (which cannot be
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:152298:128"/> proper for woemen) and ſuch be thoſe Friars of the third order in Spaine and France, who preach and teach in the ſame manner as other mendicants doe, and not without fruit, no other wiſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the Friar minors who are of the firſt order, than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious woemen encloſed doe differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poore Clares, to wit that their rule and manner of life is not ſo auſtere and hard, the reaſon wherof I haue declared before, to wit that in this holy and ſeraphicall order might be foode for all pallats.</p>

If ſo, as none can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, with what conſcience can any one withdraw her or any ſuch as shee is, from it. Specially when as there can be no better worke, no greater charitie than for a man or woman to giue and conſecrate himſelfe wholy to God. How then can any vnder whatſoeuer cloake or pretence with draw deuout ſoules from the true way of ſanctitie and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſuch as religion is. If they perſuade them to an oblation of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:152298:132"/> their goods or corporall meanes, that is but a very meane ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, being compared with the entire conſecration of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and all they haue to God which is a perfect holocauſt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine whatſoeuer ſuch pretend, the thing they deſire in ſubſtance is nothing elfe, but to haue them remaine in the world; for they are not certaine of their chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of their health, proſperitie, wealth, riches, wiſdome, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all may be loſt: but the way of religion is certaine, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and permanent, no way to be loſt.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:152298:132"/> which could bee expected from them, eſpecially being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued therto by the prayers of thoſe deuout perſons who for his loue haue forſaken their deareſt frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds and kinsfolke. And who is or can be ignorant of the manifold miſeries, and dangers of this world, which, as the foreſaid <hi>S.

But theſe will not take heede to what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly comes after, <hi>Ieſus autem ait illi, ſequere me, &amp; dimitte mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuos ſepelire mortuos,</hi> the ſpirit of truth, who can teach all perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſaith follow me, and let the dead bury the dead. Whereby we are giuen to vnderſtand that ſpirituall workes of mercy are to be preferred before corporall, and that the following of Chriſt,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:152298:133"/> is farre more excellent than the duty or reſpect we owe to our parents; for God hath more right to vs than our parents haue. True it is, we are commanded to honour our Father and mother: but firſt and with much more reaſon, we muſt honour God, we muſt loue our Parents, but aboue all God. Well ſaid that holy woman 2. <hi>Mac.</hi> 7. <hi>I know not how you appeared in my wombe, for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I giue you ſpirit, nor ſoule, nor life, and the members of euery one I my ſelfe framed not; but the creatour.</hi> O that all parents would haue this conſideration? for if the creatour did giue ſpirit, life, and ſoule to their children, can they thinke much to giue them or to permit them to giue themſelues to God. And herein I haue mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a ſtrange deceit of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:152298:134"/> for I haue knowne and heard of many, that vpon ſuch like pretenſes haue ſtaid away from entring into religion, they haue beene very well contented to trauell into farre countries, or to ſerue in the court, or ſome ſuch like place, where perhaps they shall neuer ſee their parents, much leſſe haue occaſion to helpe them, and moſt commonly are to them a great burden, vexation, and trouble, yea ſometimes to their vtter vndoing, yet all is thought well on both ſides if they enter not into religion. Can there be any greater abſurditie, than that vpon theſe aery and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded pretenſes of helping or comforting their parents and friends, they should withſtand the vocation that God hath giuen them, and yet in short time
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:152298:134"/> withdraw themſelues from their parents, ſometimes alſo with their conſent, to range them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnder ſome warlike ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards, where they may enioy one another afarre of, vntill a little bullet diſſolue all, and conclude perhaps with a diſmall end. And indeed where ſoeuer they goe, death may ſuddainely meet with them, and then the dead parent dead to God may bury his dead ſonne or daughter, which might haue happely dyed to the world, and alwayes haue liued to Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
               <p>Some others there be who are doubtfull of their abilitie and ſtrength, ſaying with Saul, <hi>Non vales reſiſtere Philiſtao iſti, nec pugnare aduerſus cum, quia puer es. Reg.</hi> 17. thou art not able to reſiſt this Philiſtian, nor to fight
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:152298:135"/> againſt him, becauſe thon art a child. You cannot perſeuer in ſuch auſteritie, your delicate and tender complexion and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot vndergoe ſuch mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, faſtings, diſciplines, and ſuch like; but theſe doe not ponder, that if they with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid goe on in the name of our lord, they neede not feare the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, and that he who giueth the vocation, will alſo grant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance, both vocation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance being the gift of God. And certaine it is that where there is a good vocation, there ſeldome or neuer can be wanting a happy perſeuerance, eſpecially where there be ſo many meanes to conſerue it. For in religion they are animated by the good examples of others, defended by many holy prayers which are
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:152298:135"/> dayly offered for them, and ſtrengthened by abundance of grace which God doth ordinarly communicate to thoſe that liue in a religious communitie. I doe not ſay but that ſome may fall, but howſoeuer it is rare, and that very great malice, which God doth moſt commonly punish with ſeuerity, and ſome publicke punishment for the abbetterment of others. As for what they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend of weakneſſe, or of tender complexion, beſides that as God giues the vocation, ſo alſo he giues ſtrength to performe it; let them take any religious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie, and they shall find ſome that haue beene as weake and tender if not more than they: yea continuall experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce teacheth vs, that thoſe who haue beene moſt tenderly bred vp, are many times
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:152298:136"/> ſuch as deſire and practiſe moſt auſteritie. And indeed who more ready to faſt, more prompt on all occaſions, than thoſe who are of more noble birth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of a more delicate education. It is admirable to ſee how humbly, with what ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſiue obedience, and with how great auſteritie and mortification kings and queenes, princes and nobles of all ſorts haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported themſelues in religion to the confuſion of thoſe who haue beene of a lower ranke by birth, though equall in religion, all ſetting their hands to the ſame plough. To this we may adde, that none ate in better health, or of longer life than religious perſons, who no way confide on their proper force and ſtrength, but on the goodneſſe and grace of God,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:152298:136"/> knoweing full well that it is not humane force which muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, but Gods particular helpe and aſſiſtance. And we all ſee the ſtrong and well able bodyes to faile and die as ſoone as the weake.</p>
               <p>Without all doubt there may be many iuſt reaſons to deſiſt from a courſe of religion begun, for many times God doth permit his ſeruants to be affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cted with ſuch infirmitie, ſickneſſe, or weakneſſe, for their greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, that they are not able to goe forward. And then ſo farre is it from being a diſparagement to them either to leaue or not enter into religion (ſuppoſeing it be not out of lightneſſe of mind or inconſtancy) that as they haue merited much before God in their pious deſires, ſo they haue
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:152298:137"/> manifeſted their loue to God being ready to doe more if they could. In which caſe their deſire of being religious, will not be without the merit and reward of religion, as the deſire of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome wants not in ſome part the crowne thereof. Nothing more frequent and ordinary than to ſee very many good ſoules ſtrongly poſſeſſed with a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſire of martyrdome, to haue beene by the diuine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hindred of the ſame; and euery day many doe attempt with a full reſolute minde that which God in his wiſedome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe diſpoſes. No man will condemne a ſouldier that valou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly enters into the field al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by accident or want of prouiſion he be forced to retire. Neither can any one blame ſuch
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:152298:137"/> vertuous ſoules who leaue reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion not through inconſtancy, or want of deuotion, or deſire to perſeuer, but becauſe it is Gods will to diſpoſe otherwiſe of them.</p>
               <p>Finally to conclude this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, omitting many other like meanes that ſome doe vſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre others from religion, as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally included in thoſe before mentioned. Some there be, who out of a great zeale to the good of ſoules, not well conſidering and pondering the ſtate and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of each one, doe ſeeke to draw others to ſome more perfect ſtate or religious courſe; which thing in itſelfe is good and pious, as <hi>S. Thomas</hi> well prooues, yet great charitie, prudence, and diſcretion are to be had therein; charitie, that it be not for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:152298:138"/> reſpects or ends, but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely for God; otherwiſe they shall find by experience, it will come to nought, and thereby diſedifie thoſe who ſee and heare it, giuing occaſion of iarres and quarrells with others which can neuer be auoided when they ſeeke any thing but Gods glory and honour; Prudence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, leaſt they should ſeeme to contradict the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pirit that calles them to ſome other ſtate more proper and conuement for them. <hi>Si ſic eum volo manere, quid ad te?</hi> If God will haue them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſo, what is that to any other, in ſtead of doing them good, they may eaſily doe them harme; and which is more, the places whereto they come are ſeldome the better for hauing them, they themſelues alſo many
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:152298:138"/> times not being contented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, which cauſes them to lead a languishing life. God diſpoſes his gifts as he pleaſes, what is man that he should reſiſt his worke: he knowes beſt to diſpoſe of each ſpirit, and conformably to giue his holy vocation. And becauſe we haue fallen on this ſubiect, it will not be amiſſe to ſpeake a word or two concerning theſe voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which I will briefly doe referring the more curious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſuch authors who haue more amply treated of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</p>

Whence it acknowledgeth no other founder, no other beginner but Chriſt, whom his Apoſtles imitating haue communicated the ſelfe ſame manner of life to ſucceding ages. So that it were great preſumption or want of faith to make ſuch a doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas the holy ſcripture and whole torrent of the Fathers and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours of the Church doe ſo highly eſteeme of ſuch a ſtate;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:152298:140"/> calling it the better part of this mortall life, the greateſt and eaſyeſt way to be ſaued, an aſſembly of Angels, and royall ſeat of Gods children.</p>
               <p>In this garden planted by God we are freed from the weeds of many euils, and replenished with all good flowers of vertues, to enioy a continuall peace of ſpirit, and a moſt perfect vnion of the will to God. Here deuout ſoules receiue the diuine influences of celeſtiall delights, a perpetuall banquet of ſpirituall conſolations. Who liſt to haue more of this ſubiect, let him read <hi>Hieronymus Platus</hi> of the happyneſſe of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſtate, and there he shall vnderſtand that a Religious life, is, without all exception, in it ſelfe, moſt happy and perfect. And conſequently it were to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:152298:140"/> impugne truth it ſelfe to deny this. I make no doubt if the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders well conſider his words and reaſons, they will cry out with the queene of Saba, <hi>Bleſſed are thy men, and bleſſed are thy ſeruants which stand before thee alwayes, and heare thy wiſdome, bleſſed are all thoſe that enioy ſo great good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the ſecond point, it is moſt certaine that as there be diuerſe manſions in heauen, ſo there are diuerſe wayes to goe to them, and diuerſe Spirits to goe by thoſe diuerſe wayes. And all are not capable of all wayes, whence our ſauiour ſaith Mat. 19. <hi>Qui poteſt capere capiat,</hi> he that can take let him take, inſinuating vnto vs that it is a hard thing to doe it, and not for euery one to doe. Wherfore he doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it but inuite vs vnto it by
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:152298:141"/> word and example, for he knew that all could not doe this, ſome being hindred by ſickneſſe, others by other occaſions, as thoſe that haue parents in extreame neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, huſband, wife, and ſuch like, generally thoſe that by the law of God are obliged to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. But ſetting aſide theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments it is moſt certaine that a religious ſtate is good for all and euery one, our Sauiour ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king generally to all, <hi>Si vis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus eſſe, vade, &amp; vende &amp;c.</hi> if thou wilt be perfect, goe ſell the things that thou haſt, and giue to the poore, and thou shalt haue treaſure in heauen, and come follow me. Which made <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> to ſay; Wilt thou be perfect, and ſtand in the higheſt top of dignitie? doe as the Apoſtles haue done, ſell thoſe things thou haſt,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:152298:141"/> and giue to the poore, and follow our Sauiour, and with naked vertue follow the naked Croſſe. What shall I multiply many words in a thing ſo cleare, when it is manifeſt that what ſoeuer Chriſt hath preached, is in it ſelfe pious, and good, euen to thee, if thou haſt no impediment, and that God shall call thee.</p>
               <p>In the third point great cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection and care is to be had, aſwell in correſponding to Gods holy vocation, as in making choiſe of what ſtate is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient; yet generally ſpeaking, that is moſt conuenient and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to any ones condition, which God inſpires; for in this, there can be no errour or deceit, the difficultie only remaines to know when ſuch a vocation is from God, which requires a
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:152298:142"/> longer treatiſe than our preſent ſubiect will permit; wherfore I briefly touch the principall.</p>
               <p>The Angel of the ſchooles <hi>S. Thomas</hi> teacheth vs, that voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are two fold, one exteriour, which is by preaching, good perſuaſion, good example, tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or affliction, yet not ſo, but that it is accompanyed with the interiour motions of the holy ghoſt; for, as <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſaith, Cor. 3. <hi>Neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth, but he that giueth encreaſe, God.</hi> Who alone breatheth thoſe inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſupernaturall life in their ſoules. The other is purely interiour by God him ſelfe, who doth illuminate and inflame their minds, but ſeuerally, for to ſome he inſpires this holy vocation by
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:152298:142"/> a powerfull operation of the will, which violently poſſeſſes the ſoule making them to approch, as. <hi>S. Paule</hi> Saith, Heb. 10. <hi>with a pure heart in fullneſſe of faith,</hi> no way doubting of Gods benefit herein, ſuch was the vocation of. <hi>S. Paule,</hi> and generally of all the Apoſtles. To others God giues the ſame grace, but after a more obſcure manner, the ſound is heard but they know not well from whence it comes; ſuch was that of <hi>Samuell,</hi> who did heare Gods call, but did not vnderſtand it. So there be many whom God calles interiourly, but they feeling it cannot tell what to doe in it. Laſtly there be ſome that haue vocations from God, but God doth vſe ſome viſible meanes to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:152298:143"/> bring them to it, ſuch was the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Heliſeus</hi> the prophet and that of the Eunuch. In all which there is required a docile heart and obedient mind to anſwer to ſuch a calling, not following our owne conceits, but to ſay with <hi>S. Paule, Domine quid me vis facere?</hi> Act. 9. Lord what wilt thou haue me to doe; or with <hi>Samuel. Loquere Domine, quia audit ſeruus tuus,</hi> Reg. 3. Speake lord, for thy ſeruant heareth; or with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Paratum cor meum Deus, paratum cor meum,</hi> my hart is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared o God, my heart is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. O lord inſtruct me the way of thy iuſtifications, and I shall be excerciſed in thy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous workes. Conduct me ô God in the path of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. And theſe may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that God will direct them:
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:152298:143"/> but with all it is very neceſſarie that they haue recourſe to ſome vertuous and ſpirituall man, that may direct them, for although God be the author of all good, yet he will haue vs to walke the way of humilitie, and to ſubmit our ſelues to others. So <hi>Saul</hi> was ſent to <hi>Ananias, Samuel</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by <hi>Helie,</hi> the Eunuch by <hi>S. Philip, Eliſeus</hi> by <hi>Elias, S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> by <hi>S. Ambroſe;</hi> with many ſuch like. So that in this affaire of ſo great importance it is good to follow counſell.</p>
               <p>If they thinke good, before they aske this counſell, and that of ſome learned, religious and vertuous perſon, they may firſt retire themſelues a little from company, and from their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary employments, thereby the better to conſider what they are
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:152298:144"/> to doe, and what motion or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration that is which they feele in themſelues.</p>
               <p>Secondly it shalbe very much expedient to goe to Confeſſion and Communion, thereby to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſtrength and force to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish Gods holy will and grace, to diſcerne and iudge what is beſt to be done.</p>
               <p>Thirdly it is good with feruour to offer vp a holocauſt of prayer, with humilitie opening their hearts, to obey and performe the will of God in all things, not ſeeking their owne pleaſure or content, but what shall pleaſe the diuine maieſtie, and with this indifferency ſo to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that they be truly reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned.</p>
               <p>Hauing done this they may take counſell, as aboue ſaid, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:152298:144"/> this affaire to their good Angels, who are giuen them principally for their direction, and then let them make no doubt of their vocation, for God will neuer be wanting to ſuch pious deſires, but according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe will hearken to ſuch as come vnto him in true humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>
               <p>Neither is it conuenient that they should expect any reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſigne from heauen, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby they might be made cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of their vocation; for it would be great temeritie, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and folly to expect ſuch extraordinary effects, when God himſelfe hath manifeſted his will in ſo ample manner, that none can doubt of it, if their owne intentions be conformable: he inuites, exhorts, and drawes all
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:152298:145"/> vnto ſuch a vocation by word and example, he hath taught it, if there be any fault, it is on our ſide. Wherfore it behooueth them to looke firſt to themſelues, and conſider with what inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they leaue the world, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they doe it purely for God, and that they haue a reſolution to obſerue whatſoeuer religion preſcribes, and becauſe in theſe and ſuch like our owne inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions many times deceiue vs, it shall be neceſſary to ſtand to the iudgement and counſell of ſome ſpirituall perſon who hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in ſuch things.</p>
               <p>When they haue done all this, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſtantly adhere to that inclination which they find in their ſoules, whether it be vnto this order or that order, this ſtate or that ſtate, deemeing that
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:152298:145"/> which God hath inſpired them with all to be 'moſt conuenient and agreeable to their diſpoſition. And when once they haue made choyſe of any ſtate, without all wauering or doubt let them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer therein, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deliberation, but aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that ſuch is the ſtate whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein God would be ſerued by them, and let them be confident that his infinite goodneſſe will giue them whatſoeuer shall be needfull for the performance of ſuch a vocation. Wherein not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they may chance to find ſome difficulties and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to withdraw them from ſo good reſolutions, yet they ought manfully to perſiſt and patiently ſupport all for Gods loue, which will ſweeten all and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:152298:146"/> make this ſeeming yoake to be moſt eaſy and pleaſing.</p>

               <p>HItherto I haue laboured to explicate the preface of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> which he ſet before this rule with intention to ſatisfie what difficulties might occurre therein, and to lay a foundation to what I am to ſay in the next part, wherein I will briefly handle each point of the rule, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the chapters and points thereof, which in this preface I could not ſo well doe.

            <p n="1">LEt them firſt conſider, with what fervour and diligence they haue forſaken the world, and all things which they had, their Parents, kindred, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and familiar friends; their natiue Country, richeſſe, their deare &amp; friendly company, for to come to this life of Penance, and die to themſelues, and to the world; which could not proceed from any little affection. Let them conſider alſo how bash fully humbly, and earneſtly they
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:152298:162"/> haue demanded to be received. Moreover how after they were received, they did beginne to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port themſelues modeſtly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly &amp; orderly in all obedience; wherfore let them alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member of this beginning, and be not weary or draw backe, nor preſume, nor be elevated, nor wax cold, nor become more bold, or negligent, but encreaſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and perſeuer fruitfully, and holyly euen to the end, in ſo happy a beginning. To this end in a figure it was commanded to the children of Iſrael, after they were gone forth out of Egipt Exod 13. <hi>Remember this day in the which our Lord brought you out of Egipt,</hi> from the Iron fourance, &amp; ſervitude of clay and bricke. So let them not ceaſe to remember how graciouſly and powerfully the holy Ghoſt hath delivered
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:152298:163"/> them out of the wicked world, from the bonds of carnalitie, from the yoake of the diuell, from the moſt hard and moſt vile ſervitude of ſinne, yea from the paines of hell, which they had merited, and wherein they had fallen, if God by his aſſiſtance, had not with, drawen them. Wherfore one of the Fathers anſwered to one, who asked him how he should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelfe: <hi>Conſider what thou haſt bene the first day when thou didst depart from the world, and when thou waſt received into the Cloiſter, and remaine the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</hi> Let them conſider how filthy a thing it is in a Cloiſter, to become tepide and ſloathfull, to be deceived &amp; vanquished by the enemie: whence it is ſaid in the Apocalipſe cap. 2. <hi>I haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt charitie.</hi> And cap. 3. <hi>becauſe</hi>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:152298:163"/> 
               <hi>thou art luke warme I will begin to vomit thee, out of my mouth.</hi> And the veſſel of Election hath ſaid. Heb. 10. <hi>If we ſinne willingly, after the knowledge of the truth received, now there is not left an hoſt for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Let them be alwayes on their guard, leaſt they be beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the enemies. Yea let them endeavour alwayes to be armed, &amp; prepared to the conflict againſt all tentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, being alwayes feare full, according to what shall be ſaid hereafter, which is alſo the counſell of S. Peter. <hi>Be ſober and watch, becauſe your adverſarie the diuell, as a roaring lion, goeth about ſeeking whom he may devoure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Let them keepe themſelues from all rash iudgements, and contempt of any one, as alſo take heede that by the examples of thoſe who comport themſelues
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:152298:164"/> negligently, they be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and ſo become ſloathfull: but let them ſeeke the diſcourſe and converſation of thoſe, who may more edefie them, and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ioyne themſelues to their company: in the meane time let them not be ſo bold, as to iudge of others, but leaue them to their iudges.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let them take heede, that they be not deceived by ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence of good; for the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne enemie, ſeeing that he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not en trappe the fervent ſpirits by any evident euill; doth endeavour to deceiue them, by things which appeare good, and are not ſo: wherfore let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſcouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, their ſuggeſtions, &amp; ſecret tentations of their hearts, to men that are capable to diſcerne them, as shalbe ſaid hereafter.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let them take heed, that
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:152298:164"/> their obſervance be reaſonable, &amp; diſcreet, and not preſently breake themſelues by watchings, abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences, and other ſuch like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſes: that they cannot conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the way of their religious Pilgrimage.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Let them conſider that the cauſe which they haue in hand with God, is vnſpeakably great, and weigh profoundly, that in short time they shalbe iudged by him. For it is altogether neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that during the time of this short and uncertaine preſent life, they should acquire meritoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the eternall beatitude, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre infernall damnation; ſo that if they duely conſider and weigh this, they will patiently and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly remaine in the Cloiſtre, &amp; in their cell, although they should be vp to the necke in vermine.</p>
            <p n="7">Laſtly for to maintaine, defend
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:152298:165"/> &amp; profite themſelues as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient; let them not ceaſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate God, and let them not faile to loue, honour, and ſupplicate the Bleſſed Virgin Advocate of Mankinde; as alſo other Saints: according to their devotion: to this end I haue here beneath tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated the prayers, which are vſed at their cloathing; that they may with the more devotion be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue vnto them in that act, as alſo vſe them during the time of their Novice ship. But firſt I will giue out of the ſame author, certaine Rules againſt temptations: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ordinarily the diuell, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of ſinnes, &amp; paſſed cuſtomes, doe aſſaile and make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Novices, ſo that in them the common ſaying is verified Iob 7. <hi>the life of man on earth is but a continuall tentation or warre.</hi> Whence commeth, that many
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:152298:165"/> Novices overcome in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, doe yeeld and fall for want of inſtruction of the manner and meanes to make reſiſtance. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profitable things haue bene written both of generall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular remedies, againſt tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I will briefely ſpeake of ſome of them.</p>
            <div type="rules_of_life">
               <head>Briefe Rules againſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</head>
               <p n="1">FIrſt let them endeavour to accomplish that of the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Eccl. 2. <hi>Sonne comming to the ſeruice of God, ſtand in iuſtice, and in feare, and prepare thy ſoule to tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And know, that as S.

Tim. 2. <hi>None are crowned, but thoſe who fight manfully;</hi> and that the elect Act 14. <hi>By many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations muſt enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</hi> Wherfore the firſt &amp;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:152298:166"/> common remedie againſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations is to know their, imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, frailtie, and inſufficiencie, and confidently to haue recourſe to Gods aſſiſtance, vnceſſantly &amp; ardently invocating his aide, in ſaying <hi>Deus in adiutorium meum intende.</hi> And ſo they muſt, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually hope in God, and neuer preſume of their proper forces or merits.</p>
               <p n="2">The ſecond remedie is to hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble &amp; miſpriſe themſelues profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea to eſteeme themſelues as nothing in all things before God; for he cannot be held by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, who is ſo little, and as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his owne eſtimation: but preſently he ſlips out of his clawes, and is receiued by God, who exalts and comforts thoſe who are ſo humbled.</p>
               <p n="3">The third remedie is, alwayes to conſider the preſence of God
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:152298:166"/> almightie, principally his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and aboue all to conſider prudently, and greatly feare the eternall ſentence.</p>
               <p n="4">The 4. is to conſider clearly, what the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are, what are the enemies of the elect, what they ſeeke, wherto they tend, what they inceſſantly machinate: truly they are moſt cruell, moſt caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, moſt envious, and finally ſeeke no other thing, than the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall damnation of men, &amp; that in the meane time, they may be withdrawen from God, depriued of all grace and vertue, made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to them, and ſullied with all vices.</p>
               <p>They neuer ceaſe to invent &amp; proſecute ſuch things, after a thouſand wayes, and practiſes, wherfore by how much more they know theſe more aſſuredly, by ſo much more foolishly they
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:152298:167"/> shall doe, if they conſent to them; and doe not reſiſt them with all their force, &amp; affections. Would any one enter into a wood of theeues, of whom he knew he should be ſtrangled.</p>
               <p n="5">The 5. to thinke diligently, what domage they incurre by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way to temptation; for by this, they looſe their ſoueraigne God, and only good; they are deſpoyled of all charitie, grace, and precedent merits. They ceaſe to be the daughters, ſervants, friends, ſouldiers, heires, &amp; mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their God; Creatour and Saviour, and conſequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his enemies and adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">The 6. is to behold continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how victoriouſly, &amp; excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſervants of God haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted temptations; and what glorie they haue gotten by ſuch
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:152298:167"/> triumph; in reading the liues of the holy Fathers, S. Antony, S. Hilarion, S. Benedict, S. Francis, they may be more fully inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p n="7">The 7. is to contemplate God almightie, his holy-Angels, and all the heauenly citizens behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their conflict againſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ready to aſſiſt them, ioyfull of their reſiſtance, and victory: and on the other ſide, conſider how much the malignant ſpirits doe rejoice together, and mocke at their fall and tranſgreſſion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Pſalmiſt Pſal. 12. <hi>They that troubled me, will reyoice if I be moved.</hi> O doe not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend leaue and miſpriſe God, who is your Creatour, and Saviour. Doe not contriſtate his B. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, moſt ready to helpe you, and moſt zealous of your ſaluation: doe not dishonour your Angel
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:152298:168"/> Guardian, who moſt ſincerely loues you, keepes you moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and admonishes you moſt faithfully, rather to follow and hearken after the ſuggeſtions of the diuell, than to the moſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome exhortations of the Angels. Doe not make your ſelues odious and contemptible to the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Church of the celeſtiall court. Doe not yeeld your ſelues to be a shame, mokquerie, &amp; prey to the moſt envious &amp; moſt cruell enemies. But rather, pray with the wiſe man. Eccl. 23. <hi>O Lord, Father and dominatour of my life; leaue me not in their counſell: leaſt I fall in the fight of mine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, and mine enemies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">The 8. is preſently to reſiſt in the beginning of the tentation, principally in the tentations of the flesh: from which as from
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:152298:168"/> their obiects, occaſions, incita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſubiects, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently to turne the eies of the ſpirit, and of the body; the imagination, fancy, memorie, and convert them to behold, and conſider ſome holy and compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue things, as beholding the crucifix and the Paſſion, the laſt endes, weighing alſo the breuitie and incertitude of this preſent life. Moreouer they ought to be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous, and laudably vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catiue: that ſo they may afflict the diuells their enemies: by ſo much more earneſtly and vnceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly addicting themſelues to all workes of vertue, principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of profound humilitie, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; Charitie, by how much more they endeavour to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them from their ſaluation: ſay with the true warrier Pſal. 17. <hi>I will purſue mine enemies, and</hi>

               </p>

For Chriſt hath giuen great power and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable vertue to his Paſſion &amp; death, wherby he hath redeemed humane kind.

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:152298:171"/> was ſadde euen to death, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying vpon his owne shoulders the heauie gibbot of the croſſe, he was moſt ignominiouſly ledde to the place of Calvarie.</p>
               <p>If they be tempted with the delights of the flesh, or with the deſires of pleaſure, diſſolution, play, ſport, vnmeaſured laughter, let them conſider the griefe that he ſuffered for vs, when his moſt delicate flesh was torne, even to the opening of his ſides, and moſt cruelly rent, with the blowes of ſcourges, when his hands and feete were tranſpier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with rough and great nailes of Iron, when his head was crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with thornes, and beaten with a reede.</p>
               <p>If they be tempted with am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, let them conſider how for our ſakes, he became <hi>reproch of men, and out caſt of the people.</hi> He

               <p>If rancour or motion of envie ſtrike them; let them remember how he faſtened to the Croſſe, &amp; already environed with anguish, and prickings of death and more interiourly tranſperced: did pray for thoſe who crucifyed him.</p>
               <p>If ſloath aſſault them, let them call to mind with what arde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie he hath procured our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Briefely in all temptations let them interiourly conſider, what and how great things he hath vndertaken, excerciſed and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for our ſaluation; with what moſt bitter and moſt cruell death he was ſlaine; and moſt violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and moſt painfully ſtretched
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:152298:172"/> forth on the Croſſe, euen ſo farre forth that one might number all his bones, yea euen to the rupture of his vaines, how he was crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with thornes, cloathed in mocquerie with a purpell robe; and his face bained in bloud, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the people, who cryed take him away, cruciſie him. Ioan. 19.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, conſider what and how great he is, he I ſay who hath ſuffered all theſe things; is not he, according to his divine nature, equall with the eternall Father, &amp; according to the Humanitie which he hath hypoſtatically taken and vnited vnto the eternall word; more worth than all the world? Let them conſider the delicateneſſe of his complexion, in that he was conceiued in the moſt ſacred wombe of the Virgin, of moſt
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:152298:173"/> pure bloud: behold his Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, contemplate how charitably ſtrongly, and moſt promptly he hath ſuffered all theſe paines.</p>
               <p>Beſides this they may conſider, that at the time of his Paſſion, the griefe of compaſſion which he ſuſtained from the vngratfull &amp; wicked Iewes was more than the corporall affliction of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Moreover how great pitie and compaſſion he had of his moſt deare Mother, ſeeing her bitterneſſe, paine, and compaſſion as alſo how greatly he did ſuffer in all thoſe who ſtood by, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout diſciples, and other women.</p>
               <p>Let them therfore carrie theſe things in their minds, and at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine houres dayly meditate, and remeditate them, as diſtinctly, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatly and compaſſionatly, as if he did endute them in their ſight and preſence. According to the

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:152298:182"/> one is tryed and excerciſed in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, reprehended for negligence, drawne by word and example to more perfect things.

               <p n="4">4. Let them conſider that how great ſoeuer the dignitie and vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of a Religious ſtate is, yet they cannot come to the height of this dignitie, but by labour; if therfore the place of dignitie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light them, let them firſt excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe themſelues in the way of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: by this path, one cometh to maieſtie: wherfore let them know that ſince they haue bene diſpoſed to enrolle themſelues in Religion, they are ranged into
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:152298:183"/> the ſocietie of Ieſus Chriſt, into the number of his Apoſtles, and ſo ought to conſider his words. <hi>He that will follow me let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce himſelfe, and take vp his croſſe, &amp;c.</hi> therfore let them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their ſoules to fight, for ſithence they haue called the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and hel to the duel, he will come with all his forces and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, as another Aman, againſt Mardocheus, for to vanquish &amp; ſurmount them; in the meane time let them be aſſured that the God of all conſolation will aſſiſt them, and will not permit that they be tempted aboue their force, but will giue aide in tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the end that they may ſuſtaine it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As they haue firmely reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, to perſeruer in Religion; ſo let them valiantly follow him, that is their head &amp; Lord; follow

                  <head>A briefe extraction of ſome perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of S. Francis, which may ſerue as a patterne for all his children.</head>
                  <p n="1">THe firſt Perfection of S. Francis, was that with all endeavour, and with all his forces he did labour to deplore his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; and did willingly confeſſe them, &amp; that without delay, and afterward in as much as he could, did take heede-not to fall againe.</p>
                  <p n="2">The 2. was that he did put all creatures aboue himſelfe, and himſelfe vnder all. And this was his reaſon: becauſe (as he ſaid) he had offended that great Lord, who had made all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and who hath ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured vs, that for our loue, he hath taken humane flesh: which aſſumed did participate of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:152298:185"/> For this he was obedient with a good heart, and good will, to all not only to greater, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall or leſſer; but alſo to all creatures in as much as was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him.</p>
                  <p n="3">The 3. Perfection was the loue of God, wherby he had roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of his heart all worldly and humane creatures: neither did he find any foundation, root, or reſt, but in him who made his heart. For this he was wont to caſt his heart vnto Chriſt, who had made it, and ſo excerciſed his heart in him, that without any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, when he would, he could fix his mind on him, and from thence was alwayes attentiue to God, in all places, and in all times.</p>
                  <p n="4">The 4. Perfection was, that he was of ſuch patience, that he did endeavour to loue him more
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:152298:186"/> that did doe or ſpeake euill vnto him: and with all his heart, and with a good will, would more willingly ſerue him without all bitterneſſe of minde, becauſe as God out of his liberalitie did giue all good things to him; ſo he did belieue that God did permit all euill things to happen vnto him; to manifeſt therby his ſinnes vnto him; &amp; that ſo he himſelfe might acknowledge and take notice of them: and that God did punish them in this preſent life: and therfore he did much loue him that did doe or ſpeake ill of him: becauſe by, his mediation, as by his meſſenger, God did giue vnto him ſo great good, to purifie him from his ſinnes.</p>
                  <p n="5">The 5. was that he loued all good men, and did compaſſionate all euill; and did honour all, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe the baſeſt yea worſt
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:152298:186"/> of all men. And this becauſe, he did not know, whether the good which he did doe, did pleaſe God, or whether he should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer therein: neither did he know the end, wherto another might come: and for this, he iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged none. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did heare any euill of any one, either he did excuſe him, or in hearing did shew himſelfe ſadde, or did who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turne the words of the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to ſome other matter.</p>
                  <p n="6">The 6. was, that he did much loue reprehenſions, &amp; them who reprehended him. And if any ill thing was ſpoken of him; he granted it: if they did ſay any good, he excuſed himſelfe, and ſaid, that he did no good: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his minde, that God did doe and giue all good.</p>
                  <p n="7">The 7. was, that he did wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſerue all, and would ſcarce
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:152298:187"/> permit any one to ſerue him: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting himſelfe vnworthy of all ſeruice; for, ſaid he, Chriſt did not come to be miniſtred vnto but to miniſter; If therfore any one did ſerue him, in any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, in his heart he gaue thankes to God: who gaue him that will to ſerue, and to be able to doe it.</p>
                  <p n="8">The 8. was, that he did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to contemplate all Gods benefits in himſelfe, in others; yea in all creatures; and did giue thankes to God for all of them; &amp; afterward humbling himſelfe did ſay, who am I? that I should giue thankes for others, when I am not ſufficient to giue thanke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="9">The 9. was the guard of his tongue, with out which all good is eaſily loſt for he did abſtain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p n="10">10. Aboue all things he did take care, that in euery word of his, there should be truth, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and humilitie. Becauſe the words of a man, ought to begin in truth, proceed in goodneſſe, &amp; end in humilitie; and be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in breuitie.</p>
                  <p n="11">The 11. was his great Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; which he eſteemed as his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Spouſe, becauſe that it had bene ſo dignified in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and his Bleſſed Mother. And therfore he left this as an inheritance to all his children.</p>
                  <p n="12">The 12. was, his prompt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which he eſteemed aboue all other things: becauſe it did ſo shine in our Saviour, who was obedient to his Father, euen to
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:152298:188"/> the death of the croſſe, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our holy Father ſaid, he would as willingly obey to a Novice of one dayes ſtanding, as to the eldeſt of the houſe; if he were made his Superiour.</p>
                  <p>To omit many other rare Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which the devout Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may gather in his life: the laſt &amp; principall was his tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, of our Saviours Paſſion: whereby he did merite to receiue the ſtigmats or markes of Chriſt Ieſus crucifyed.</p>
                  <p>After this example, devout ſoules in reading the liues of Saincts, may gather the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall perfections, or rareſt vertues, which haue bene in the Saincts; that they may lay them vp in ſtore, to benefit themſelues by their examples.</p>
                  <p>To conclude I will adde the words of S. Hierome in the firſt
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:152298:188"/> chapter of his Rule.
<q>Chriſt <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> hath instructed women placed in Monaſteries; what manner of life they should principally take; ſaying, Mat. <hi>19.</hi> If thou wilt enter into life keepe the commandements, and what thoſe are he hath tought, ſaying, thou shall loue the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and thy neigbour as thy ſelfe: diligently conſider; that without the fullfilling of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, no man entreth to liue with God: therfore the Apoſtle doth not glorie in the tongues of Angels, and men; nor in the knowledge of the misteries of God; nor in the ſpirit of Prophecy, but in charitie. This alone doth make men liue to God; This maketh Religious, monkes &amp; Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Without charitie, Monaſteries are but hell, and thoſe who dwell in them, are but divells. But with charitie, Monaſteries are Paradiſes, on earth: and thoſe who abide in
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:152298:189"/> them, are Angels: therfore my moſt beloved daughters, although long faſts doe make your bodies leane, and abiect; and poore garments deforme them; and long offices be performed, if charitie be wanting within, you are not as yet come to the lowest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Religion. It is a good &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant thing for Siſters to dwell in one, that is in one bond of loue, and affection of charitie: who doe helpe one another in tentation, &amp; mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adminiſter to each other, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of charitie and pietie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let there be one heart, one ſoule, in you, corporally vnited; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinely there is no life worſe, than to liue together in body, and not in minde and they are truly vnhappy, in whom there is not one will, but diverſe: therfore let there be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in you, one affection, one fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie, one will, one proportion of manners, one ioy, one ſadneſſe: let
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:152298:189"/> not that, which in our Lord is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to one, be diſpleaſing to another; neither that which is the ioy of one, be the griefe of another: and ſo ye may haue the propoſed end, and virtue of Religion, if yee dwell vnanimouſly in the houſe of Lord.</q>

                     <pb n="349" facs="tcp:152298:192"/> 
                     <hi>accomplish it for our ſelues, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intention to pleaſe God, or profit our</hi> Siſters, <hi>but to ſatisfie the proper motions of our ſpirit.</hi> This is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to charitie.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Renounce your proper iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, not too much confiding or relying vpon your owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: for euen as amongſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and imperfect perſons, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate loue of earthly things, doth ordinarily raiſe ſtrifes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, ſo amongſt ſpirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the diverſitie of ſenſe, and iudgement, ordinarily engendreth diſcord. Now you may obtaine this abnegation of your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by true humilitie of heart, if you eſteeme others more wiſe, and ſtayed; and your ſelues more foolish, and leſſe experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Hearken to S. Paule praying each one Phil. 2. <hi>If therfore, there be any conſolation, in Ieſus Chriſt, if</hi>

Nothing by contention, neither by vaine glorie, but in humilitie, each counting other better than the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues.</hi>

Thinke ſeriouſly, that there is nothing ſo great, profitable, or pretious: which may be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the good of charitie, and vnion: wherfore order all your exteriour things, all your affaires, in ſuch ſort, that the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall charitie may not be preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced; but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerved; with the loſſe and intereſt of all other things.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Be neuer angry againſt your Siſter, how iuſt an occaſion ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you haue, according to your ſeeming: for anger doth blind the vnderſtanding, and looſeth the good of peace and charitie; you

Doe not promiſe to your ſelfe long life, but thinke that you may preſently die; and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome your ſelfe with tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſpirit, to ſuffer iniuries and wrongs; from your Siſters; as you would doe, if you were at point of death: when you would not eſteeme of ſuch things, but rather apply your mind to God. wherfore euen now conſider all things which are done and ſaid, as if they did no way touch you;
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:152298:194"/> and ſo you shall not be any wayes troubled; and shall offer all to God as voluntarie Sacrifices.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Conſider and reuerence Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in every one; for you ought not ſo much to conſider the perſon, as God, who by his eſſence, preſence, and power is in all things; and principally in ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall creatures: and therfore for his ſake you ought to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret all their words, and works in good part: or if you cannot, returne to your owne ſelfe, and conſider whether there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in you, that may diſpleaſe God, who is preſent: where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you may find greater faults, and therfore you may the better ſupport the imperfections of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
